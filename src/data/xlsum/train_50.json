        "text":"By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website\n\nThere is growing - but certainly guarded - talk within the World Health Organization that the overall number of new cases is levelling off. \n\nOfficials have told me they now expect the figure to stick at around 1,000 fresh cases each week.\n\nIt is in sharp contrast to the early phase of the outbreak when the number was doubling every three to four weeks.\n\nBack in September, a major report by a team at the WHO and Imperial College London was estimating 20,000 cases by today (November 2). \n\nInstead the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases stands at 13,567.\n\nThose early predictions, based on mathematical modelling, were hugely important for making the world pay attention to the severity of the outbreak. \n\nThey were based on the \"exponential growth phase\" of the epidemic, in which the rate of new infections soar. \n\nBut now that exponential phase may be over. \n\nLevelling off?\n\nDr Christopher Dye, the director of strategy in the office of the director general at the World Health Organization, has the challenge of predicting the spread of Ebola. \n\n\"Things clearly have changed with respect to the trajectory of the epidemic,\" he told the BBC News website. \n\n\"What we've seen is, very clearly, a slowing down in the some of the affected areas in the three countries.\"\n\nLofa county in Liberia as well as Kenema and Kailahun district in Sierra Leone are held up as areas making strong progress. \n\nDr Dye added: \"When we look at the total epidemic now, with the best information we have got available I would guardedly say that the case incidence per week is not going to get larger than it is at the moment, so around 1,000 cases per week.\n\n\"In terms of the trend of the epidemic, it is possible it has flattened out.\n\n\"We know there's under-reporting so we have to emphasise caution, but broadly we're out of this big epidemic growth phase seen in August and September.\"\n\n\n                  Ebola deaths                \n\n\n                      Figures up to 13 January 2016                    \n\n11,315\n\nDeaths - probable, confirmed and suspected\n\n\n\n(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)\n\n4,809 Liberia \n\n3,955 Sierra Leone \n\n2,536 Guinea \n\n8 Nigeria \n\nTiger waiting to pounce\n\nEven if it is confirmed, 1,000 cases per week is still no cause for celebration.\n\nThat would be the equivalent of every other Ebola outbreak in history happening every fortnight. \n\nAnd any attempt to claim Ebola is being contained is \"like saying your pet tiger is under control\", as the WHO's Dr Bruce Aylward put it last week.\n\nThere is still clearly a huge amount of work ahead.\n\nHowever, Dr Nick Golding from the University of Oxford shares the broad view that the dynamics of the outbreak are shifting. \n\nHe said: \"That's probably right when you look at the whole outbreak, but in specific areas it's still growing exponentially. \n\n\"It certainly looks like that for Liberia and the capital Monrovia; it appears to have plateaued in the past two months of data and there's a similar sort of thing in Guinea, but I'm not sure we can say that for Sierra Leone.\"\n\nBad stats\n\nHowever, the data remains extremely poor.\n\nThis is particularly pertinent in Liberia - where new cases are supposedly falling - as only 38% of the reported cases are actually laboratory confirmed, compared with 85% in Guinea.\n\nThere is also the overhanging spectre of vast numbers of unreported cases - the best guess is there are around twice as many cases out there as have been reported. \n\nNew predictions on the future of the outbreak are expected soon as scientists get to grips with the changing shape of the epidemic.\n\nIt seems certain that the early prediction by the US Centres of Disease Control of 1.4 million cases by January is way too high.\n\nBut Dr Dye concluded: \"Even if we are able to say the exponential phase is over, our goal is complete elimination in the human population and we clearly have a long way to go on that.\n\n\"If we could show cases falling in every area - and we can't - we would still have a major job on our hands.\"\n\n"

        "text":"By Douglas FraserBusiness\/economy editor, Scotland\n\nIt also found a shortage of suitable skills at middle career level. \n\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) Scotland said skills training has some elements that perform at least as well as the rest of Britain\n\nBut it concluded that training for those aged 16 and over is not focused on current or future demand.\n\nThe think tank has challenged Scots to look beyond comparison with the rest of the United Kingdom if it is to compete economically.\n\nIts report, Jobs and Skills in Scotland, found 118,000 jobs were created between 2010 and 2015, when the economy was struggling to recover from recession.\n\nHowever, the jobs recovery has been weaker than the rest of the UK, and Scotland's employment rate has gone, in those years, from being higher than the UK average to being lower.\n\nJobs growth in Scotland has been in lower-skill sectors while losing jobs in higher skill industries - including financial services, down by nearly 10% in Scotland between 2010 and 2015.\n\nThere has been more of a balance in Scotland between manufacturing and the service sector than across the rest of Britain, where 87% of new jobs have been in services.\n\nThe gap between Scotland and the rest of Britain on average pay and productivity has been narrowed, but largely because the wider UK economy has seen productivity stall.\n\nAmong the particular problems of the Scottish jobs market is the lowest rate in Britain of career progression from low-skill to higher-skill employment. British career progression is low by international standards.\n\nThere is also a mismatch of job vacancies in Scotland with middle-level skills at early career level, with around 29,000 too few people qualified to fill them.\n\nIPPR Scotland recommends reform which links funding and effort more strongly to career progression, productivity and tackling in-work poverty.\n\nIt urges better integration of employer needs with engagement of young people. A new regional regime is recommended, combining budgets.\n\nThe think tank also recommends that skills training should be directed towards new ways of learning that prepare younger people for future jobs, linked to demographic and technological change.\n\nMore ambition \n\nRussell Gunson, director of IPPR Scotland, commented: \"This report shows that while Scotland has seen a jobs recovery in recent years, there are real concerns looking ahead.\n\n\"Scotland needs to be more ambitious than aiming to match the UK economy. When UK pay has been falling in real-terms and productivity has stalled, we need to do more than catch up with the UK.\n\n\"It's not good enough that if you are currently in a low-skilled job in Scotland, you are more likely to stay in low-skilled employment than in most of the rest of the UK, and many other countries in Europe.\n\nKeith Brown, the new economy secretary at the Scottish government, welcomed the report's positive findings about strengths in the Scottish jobs market, and pointed to the administration's commitment to expand the Modern Apprenticeship scheme over the next five years.\n\nHe added: \"We have announced a review of enterprise and skills agencies to ensure we maximise our skills and economic interventions to support businesses and development opportunities, develop the skills the economy needs and create a competitive and supportive business environment\".\n\n"

Death by careless driving has a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nDuncan Dollimore, Cycling UK's head of campaigns, said: \"Adding one or two new offences specific to cyclists would be merely tinkering around the edges.\n\n\"If the government is serious about addressing behaviour that puts others at risk on our roads, they should grasp the opportunity to do the job properly, rather than attempt to patch up an area of legislation that's simply not working.\"\n\nBut Mr Briggs said there was a \"gap in the law\" after cyclist Charlie Alliston was jailed for 18 months for the death of his wife, Kim Briggs, last year. \n\nAlliston was riding a fixed gear bike with no front brakes when he hit the 44-year-old mother-of-two as she crossed a road in east London in February 2016. \n\nThe cyclist was cleared of manslaughter, but found guilty of causing bodily harm by \"wanton or furious driving\" - a Victorian-era law intended for drivers of horse-drawn carriages which carries a maximum sentence of two years.\n\nUnder the current law, this offence is the closest thing to dangerous driving a cyclist can be charged with.\n\n\"This public consultation is an important step towards updating the arcane laws that are currently being used to prosecute cycling offences,\" said Mr Briggs.\n\n'Not fit for purpose'\n\nThe number of cases involving collisions between cyclists and pedestrians remains relatively low. \n\nDepartment for Transport figures for 2016 show that 448 pedestrians were killed on Britain's roads, but only three cases involved bicycles.\n\nBy contrast, Cycling UK said that 99.4% of deaths on the road in the last ten years involved a motor vehicle.\n\nThe charity claims both cyclists and pedestrians are regularly being failed by existing road safety legislation. \n\n\"The way the justice system deals with mistakes, carelessness, recklessness and deliberately dangerous behaviour by all road users hasn't been fit for purpose for years,\" said Mr Dollimore.\n\nCycling and Walking Minister Jesse Norman said the government had already announced a range of measures to protect \"vulnerable road users\" including:\n\nIn addition, the Department for Transport has announced further measures, including a review of the Highway Code to make it clearer to motorists how to safely pass cyclists.\n\nMr Norman said: \"All these measures are designed to support the continued growth of cycling and walking, with all the benefits they bring to our communities, economy, environment and society.\"\n\n"

We believe that an investigatory service aimed at whistleblowing cases across the NHS could make a real difference to the experience of those raising concerns in the health sector, but this is not the service we provide to NHS Scotland or in any event.\n\n\"Raising concerns in any sector can present real challenges and far too often those who speak truth to power suffer as a result.\"\n\nShe added: \"Our service receives outstanding feedback from those who use it and it is incredibly valuable to have access to truly independent advice, but we cannot remove the risk of a negative response entirely - the real power here lies with the health boards and the regulators.\n\n\"As a society we must do more to celebrate and champion whsitleblowing rather than allow the suffering to continue. There is much work to do.\"\n\n'External review'\n\nHealth Secretary Shona Robison, said:  \"All staff should have the confidence to speak up without fear and with the knowledge that any genuine concern will be treated seriously and investigated properly. \n\n\"The NHS confidential alert line provides a safe place where they can confidentially raise any concerns they may have about malpractice and wrongdoing in NHS Scotland. \n\n\"Increasingly, callers have raised their concern internally first, which may suggest staff feel more confident using internal procedures. \n\n\"The alert line sits alongside the wider package of measures we have developed over the past few years to support NHS staff. \n\n\"Work is also under way to establish the independent national whistleblowing officer who will provide external review on the handling of whistleblowing cases in NHS Scotland.\"\n\n"

The last thing is that the tidal surge level is slightly lower than Friday.\n\n\"So we have our fingers crossed - we won't know the outcome until after the tidal surge at around a quarter to three (14:45 GMT).\"\n\nIn County Down, police said high tide is expected at about 14:30 GMT and they have set up a \"multi-agency response group\" at Ardmore PSNI station in Newry.\n\nIt follows flooding on the Shore Road between Warrenpoint and Rostrevor during high tide on Sunday.\n\nOfficers said sandbags are available for collection at Newry sports centre, Warrenpoint fire station, Kilbroney forest park in Rostrevor, Kilkeel leisure centre, and Marine Park in Annalong.\n\nDown District Council said sandbags can be collected from its depot on Strangford Road, Downpatrick, and from Bann Road recycling centre in Castlewellan until 16:00 GMT.\n\nThousands of sandbags have been given out in east Belfast in recent days.\n\nAlliance MP Naomi Long said the situation in east Belfast would be \"touch and go\" until high tide had passed on Monday afternoon.\n\nShe advised residents in areas at risk to \"get as much of your stuff upstairs as possible\" and have a bag packed in case of emergency evacuation.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster, Ms Long said the theft of some sandbags in the area at the weekend had been carried out by a tiny minority.\n\n\"There are  plenty of sandbags available for people. There is no need to take sandbags away,\" she said.\n\nMs Long paid tribute to the services and agencies for their \"swift response\" to the situation over the weekend.\n\nSandbags were also put in place in Londonderry city centre as a precaution, but fears over flooding in Derry city centre have eased, following a high tide on Monday morning.\n\nDerry city centre manager, Jim Roddy said: \"Sandbags were necessary. There were fears that the River Foyle would burst.\n\n\"Preparations were kept in place for this morning and we were constantly getting updates from the PSNI, Foyle Port and Harbour and other emergency services.\n\n\"In 2004 we had a disaster at Victoria Market near the pumping station and we didn't want that again,\" Mr Roddy added.\n\nSandbags were also distributed in a number of coastal towns in County Down on Sunday. \n\nStrong winds and high tides caused serious flooding in County Down on Sunday. \n\nThe Portaferry Road in the Ards Peninsula was closed for a time as was the main road between Rostrevor and Warrenpoint and the A2 Station Road in Killough.\n\nAll ferry sailings between Rathlin and Ballycastle have been cancelled on Monday due to weather conditions.\n\nElsewhere in the UK, the Met Office has also issued yellow alerts for the west coast of Britain.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the west coast is expected to see some of the strongest gusts on Monday.\n\nSome streets in central Cork were impassable for a time on Monday morning as the River Lee burst its banks again, but the water has since receded.\n\nMet \u00c9ireann (the Irish Meteorological Service) has issued its second highest alert for wind.\n\nA status orange, which means to be be prepared for possible disruption, is in place for Wexford, Galway, Mayo, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Waterford.\n\nGusts of up to 100 to 120km per hour could hit exposed coastal areas. \n\nAnyone who wishes to report flooding can call a flooding incident line on 0300 2000 100 or the police non-emergency line on 0845600 8000.\n\n"

        "text":"By Jonathan MarcusDefence and diplomatic correspondent\n\nIn many ways it is surprising that this is the first major incident to involve the accidental shooting down of an aircraft, given the intensity of the long-running and multiple air campaigns under way over Syria. \n\nRussia and its Syrian allies are attacking rebel positions from the air. The US and its allies have been striking Islamic State group targets although, with a brief up-tick over recent days, this campaign is winding down. \n\nIsrael is conducting an entirely separate air campaign both to contain Iran's military presence in Syria and, especially, to prevent the manufacture and transfer of advanced missiles to Iran's regional ally, Hezbollah, in southern Lebanon. \n\nRussia has powerful radars and modern surface-to-air missiles at its base in Syria, but it chooses to watch the Israeli operations unfold and do nothing. \n\nTo try to avoid accidents and confrontations in Syria's skies a so-called de-confliction system has been put in place. \n\nThe US is able to exchange information with and contact Russian commanders. Israel has established its own hot-line through which Russian-speaking military air controllers can talk to their counterparts at the Russian air base in Syria. \n\nThere have been close shaves; sometimes information has not been forthcoming from one side or another, but the de-confliction regime has generally worked.\n\nThe incident involving the Russian intelligence gathering aircraft is exactly the sort of thing these procedures were intended to avoid. So what went wrong?\n\nThe one thing that both Israel and Russia agree on is that the plane was downed by a Russian-supplied Syrian surface-to-air missile battery - in all likelihood an S-200, known in western circles as an Sa-5 or by its Nato code-name Gammon. \n\nIsrael insists it is the Syrians who must shoulder the blame; the downing of the aircraft was due, they say, to \"extensive and inaccurate Syrian anti-aircraft fire\". \n\nRussia though holds Israel ultimately to blame, making two charges:\n\nFirstly, that they were only belatedly warned of the Israeli mission north of Latakia, with just one minute's notice. \n\nAnd secondly, that the Israeli pilots used the Ilyushin-20 as \"cover\". In other words, the \"Israeli pilots put it in the line of fire coming from the Syrian air defences\".\n\nRussia has released a map showing what they say are the details of the incident. \n\nThe Ilyushin takes off from the Russian base at Hmeimim and flies eastwards and then north, before flying southwards and then west - essentially a figure of eight. It then turns back towards the air base heading east again when it is hit over the Mediterranean Sea. \n\nThe Russians show the track of the Israeli jets, which appear to have released their air-launched weapons at Syrian ground targets north of Latakia from a position to the west or seaward side of the Russian aircraft. \n\nIsrael argues that the Russians' facts are wrong. It expresses regret at the loss of life but insists that the de-confliction system is working well. \n\nIt says that the Syrian batteries fired \"indiscriminately\" and that the Israeli jets were actually in Israeli air space - so well to the south of where the Russians say they were - at the moment when the Ilyushin was hit.\n\nWhat is noteworthy in the Israeli account is that they actually note the targets that they were attacking, said to be a Syrian facility to manufacture \"accurate and lethal weapons\" (almost certainly missiles) which were \"about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon\". \n\nIt is unusual for Israel to acknowledge any of its strikes in Syria. \n\nIsrael also says that it will \"share all the relevant information with the Russian Government to review the incident and to confirm the facts in this inquiry\".\n\nRussia is clearly angry. It has lost an aircraft and the lives of its 15-person crew. It needs to register its displeasure but is also reluctant to condemn its regional ally Syria. \n\nIsrael and Russia have a remarkably close relationship and a clear understanding about Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in the region. So might this episode change this? \n\nI think that is doubtful. For one thing the air campaign in Syria is seen by Israel as a vital strategic necessity to thwart, as they see it, Iran's growing influence. \n\nAnd for Russia to try to physically interfere with Israeli operations would go entirely against the policy pursued by Moscow up till now.\n\nIt also might require the deployment of additional resources in Syria, which again is unlikely at a time when Russia is hoping to scale down its practical involvement there. \n\nIsrael may need to scale back its air operations for a period. But this crisis will almost certainly blow over. \n\nThink back in Syria. It was not so long ago that Turkey deliberately shot-down a Russian jet. There were short-term consequences, but Turkey subsequently became a close partner of Moscow in trying to resolve the Syrian crisis. \n\nIn this case it is the competence of Syria's air defence brigades that probably most alarms the Russians in private. That is probably where the information sharing needs to be improved. \n\nPresident Putin seems to have decided to avoid making a drama out of the crisis, noting that \"chance circumstances\" were behind the downing of the Russian plane and that this episode was very different to the shooting down of the Russian jet by Turkish forces in November 2015.\n\n"

        "text":"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter\n\nLinkin Park weren't the first band to fuse metal and rap, but they were the most successful.\n\nTheir first album, Hybrid Theory, was certified diamond in the US, representing 10 million sales. Around the world, they sold more than 50 million records.\n\nWhat set them apart from other nu metal acts like Korn and Limp Bizkit was the vocal interplay between its two frontmen.\n\nChester Bennington's guttural screams tussled with Mike Shinoda's matter-of-fact rapping in a volatile expression of rage and frustration, while DJ Joseph Hahn framed the band's thrashing guitars with sampled dystopian soundscapes.\n\nMusically, they were miles apart from the sense-dulling artlessness of many of their contemporaries, inspired by contemporary Asia, postmodernism and sample culture. They weren't afraid to show their vulnerability on songs like Numb and In The End.\n\nLinkin Park released a collaborative EP with Jay-Z, and invited grime star Stormzy onto their latest album, One More Light - a brave, if not entirely successful, venture into mainstream pop.\n\nThey never swore on record until 2007's Minutes to Midnight (something which boosted their commercial ascent); their lyrics were vivid enough without curse words.\n\n\"There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface \/ Consuming, confusing \/ This lack of self-control I fear is never ending,\" he sang on Crawling, a single from their debut album.\n\n\"I tried so hard and got so far,\" he sang on their biggest hit, In The End, \"but in the end, it doesn't even matter.\"\n\nBennington was candid about the dark times that inspired these songs - he was molested as a child, and later struggled with drug and alcohol problems.\n\n\"I literally hated life,\" he told Rock Sound in 2015. \"I was like, 'I don't want to have feelings. I want to be a sociopath. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to care what other people feel like. I want to feel nothing.'\"\n\nAs a result, Bennington often sang as if he was fighting for his life and, sometimes, it felt like he was winning. \"Every scar is a story I can tell,\" he sang on Sharp Edges, released earlier this year.\n\nIn retrospect, it's tempting (and easy) to find hints of suicidal thoughts in Bennington's lyrics - but that detracts from the complexity of his writing, which could be fragile and empathetic as often as it was angst-ridden.\n\nOutside of music, he tried to be a force for positivity, too - setting up the fund Music for Relief with the rest of Linkin Park, and playing a range of concerts to raise money for victims of disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 tsunami. \n\nOn their latest album, the band teamed up with a charity installing solar panels in communities without electricity in Africa, Haiti and Jordan.\n\nThe lyrics to the title track, too, saw Bennington reach out to fans suffering depression like his own: \"If they say \/ Who cares if one more light goes out? \/ Well I do.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

This, combined with the effects of climate change, is leaving the Amazon much more likely to catch fire. \n\nAnother member of the team, Dr Alexander Lees from Cornell University, said that many bird species unique to the Amazon were suffering the most from these effects. These endemic species, he said, \"cannot survive in disturbed forests\".\n\n\"We need to keep focusing on reducing deforestation,\" said Prof Barlow, \"but we need to think about forest disturbance - how we can monitor it, how we can reduce it, and how we can maintain pristine forest in large blocks as well.\" \n\n\"Immediate action is required to combat forest disturbance in tropical nations,\" said Silvio Ferraz from the University of Sao Paulo, who was also involved in the study. \"This is particularly important in Brazil, which holds up to 40% of the world's remaining tropical forests\". \n\nProf Barlow added: \"If we're interested in conserving the life that lives with us on this planet today, then we need to conserve these systems.\"\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter\n\n"

These price increases will help us maintain the quality of service that is expected by our customers,\"\n\nThe likelihood has increased that Royal Mail in the UK will be loss-making in 2020-21, the company said in a statement, adding: \"We want to invest \u00a31.8bn in the UK to turnaround, grow and sustain the Universal Service.\" \n\nIt said it understands that many companies and households are finding it hard in the current economic environment.\n\n\"As a result, we have considered any pricing changes very carefully and in doing so have sought to minimise any impact on our customers.\"\n\nBut the move has angered small businesses. \"When the cost of doing business is already rising across the board, this latest rise in stamp costs for letters and for parcels is just another expense that small businesses will be forced to carry, affecting small firms that rely on Royal Mail as a major part of their business,\" said Federation of Small Businesses national chair Mike Cherry.\n\n\"We should be doing all we can to support small firms to grow and succeed, price hikes like this only prevent that. From next month it will be twice as expensive to post a letter as it was in 2006.\"\n\nCommunications watchdog Ofcom said: \"Royal Mail has the flexibility to set its own prices in order to respond to a rapidly-changing market and safeguard the universal postal service. Ofcom imposed a cap on the price of a Second Class stamp to protect vulnerable consumers, and these price increases are within this safeguard. \n\n\"Royal Mail has assured us that these price changes will be clearly communicated to customers and we will continue to monitor its performance closely, to ensure that the postal market is working well for consumers.\"\n\nMeanwhile consumer experts advised people to stock up on stamps before the price rise, to beat the increase.\n\nGuy Anker, deputy editor of Moneysavingexpert.com said: \"As stamps just say 1st or 2nd on them (Or 1st or 2nd large for the bigger ones) if you buy them now they are valid in perpetuity after. \n\n\"So while it's only pennies, if you're going to send even a big batch of Christmas cards, you may as well stock up now.\" \n\n"

Welfare reform, for example, should be based on the need to improve people's lives, not just raise their incomes.\"\n\nMr Clegg, who is overseeing the government's policy on social mobility, said making improvements would be \"like turning the wheel on an oil tanker\", but promised towards them over the long term.\n\nHe said: \"Fairness means everyone having the chance to do well, irrespective of their beginnings.\n\n\"Fairness means that no one is held back by the circumstances of their birth. Fairness demands that what counts is not the school you went to or the jobs your parents did, but your ability and your ambition.\n\n\"In other words, fairness means social mobility.\"\n\nBut, he argued that this had, at best \"flatlined\" over recent decades, with \"inter-generational\" poverty still common.\n\nQuestioned about his own background, Mr Clegg, who was educated at public school and Cambridge University, said: \"The evidence is absolutely overwhelming that the circumstances of birth on what a person will be... is far, far too great.\"\n\nThe deputy prime minister said the coalition would tackle \"social segregation\" and had begun to do so by taking many of the lowest earners out of paying income tax.\n\nIn education, resources would be focused on the most disadvantaged, during early years and schooling.\n\nMr Clegg added that the Sure Start programme set up under Labour would go \"back to its original purpose of early intervention, increasing its focus on the neediest families\".\n\nMr Miliband told BBC News: \"Anyone who cares about social mobility can't believe anything they hear from a government who expect the poor to take the greatest burden.\"\n\nHe added that the coalition's tax policies would \"hit social mobility, rather than help it\".\n\nMr Miliband also said he was \"proud\" of Labour's record on social mobility but \"not satisfied\".\n\n"

Yes it will.\"\n\nIn his answer, the prime minister also said he would introduce measures to put the UK Parliament's sovereignty \"beyond doubt\" at the same time as concluding his EU negotiations.\n\nBBC deputy political editor James Landale said this suggested how the PM might attempt to persuade Mr Johnson to back the campaign to remain in the EU.\n\nThe London mayor has previously argued that it would be better if Britain was able to block EU laws on its own, without having to rely on the support of other member states.\n\n'More to do'\n\nAsked before the debate about whether he supported Mr Cameron's reforms, he said: \"Most people looking at this will think there's a lot more to do.\"\n\nIn an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cameron denied having compromised over welfare curbs for EU migrants and defended his decision to ban ministers from campaigning to leave the EU until after the summit.\n\nEveryone in government, he said, was \"committed to making these renegotiations as good as they can possibly be\".\n\nBut the BBC understands several Eurosceptic ministers - including Commons leader Chris Grayling - are discussing whether to break ranks before Mr Cameron announces the date of a referendum.\n\nFormer defence secretary Liam Fox said he was \"certain\" four or five cabinet ministers would eventually join the campaign to leave, adding that the offer on the table meant that \"what we can get, at best, is better membership of the wrong club\".\n\nMr Cameron told MPs the details would need to be pinned down during the course of the \"intense\" round of negotiations - but the draft deal hammered out with top EU officials was the strongest ever achieved on freedom of movement rules.\n\nThe prime minister urged Tory MPs to vote \"with their hearts\" based on what they believed was right for Britain and not what \"might be advantageous\" to them personally.\n\nThat did not stop Eurosceptic Tory MPs lined up to criticise it, with Jacob Rees-Mogg saying Mr Cameron had two weeks to salvage his reputation as a negotiator after serving up \"thin gruel\" which had been further watered down.\n\nFirst ministers protest\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party wanted the UK to remain in the EU but he dismissed the prime minister's renegotiations as a \"smoke and mirrors sideshow\" and said he had \"ended up exactly where he knew he would be, making the case to remain in Europe\".\n\nIn a separate development, the first ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to Mr Cameron calling on him not to hold the EU referendum in June. \n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron insisted voters would be \"perfectly capable\" of coping with two separate ballots.\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage, meanwhile, told MEPs Mr Cameron's deal was \"hardly worth the wait\" and \"really rather pathetic\", adding that it had \"no treaty change, no powers returned, and no control of our borders\". \n\nBut European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker talked up the draft deal in a speech to the European Parliament, saying it addressed Mr Cameron's concerns \"while respecting the treaties\".\n\nThe draft deal includes an \"emergency brake\" to restrict in-work benefits for EU migrants. But it would have to be agreed by other EU nations and it would be \"graduated\", with more money from tax credits paid to migrants the longer they remain in the UK. \n\nThe draft says Mr Cameron's demand to exempt Britain from the EU principle of \"ever-closer union\" between member states would be written into a future treaty. There are also measures relating to protection for non-euro countries in the EU, to a new way for member states to club together to block some new EU laws and on business regulations.\n\n"

        "text":"Downing Street said David Cameron would say on Monday that councils would have to introduce a residency test to stop immigrants gaining immediate access. \n\nLocal authorities can already set their own criteria, but many do not.\n\nThe Local Government Association said it was \"very concerned\", and councils should decide how to meet housing need. \n\nBoth Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg have recently given speeches on immigration.\n\nAnd a poll conducted in Eastleigh on the day of the by-election on 28 February suggested 55% of people who voted for UKIP - which came second - said the issue was their biggest reason for supporting the party.\n\nMigrant 'expectations'\n\nThe government says about 9% of new social lettings go to foreign nationals, a rise from 6.5% in 2007\/08. According to official figures, foreign nationals make up 12% of the population.\n\nMr Cameron will say that the government will issue statutory guidance to local authorities.\n\nHe wants to remove \"any expectation that new migrants can expect the British taxpayer to give them a home on arrival\".\n\nA social housing applicant would have to live in an area for between two and five years before going on the waiting list.\n\nHe is expected to say that \"this will stop someone from turning up and immediately gaining access to social housing\". \n\nExceptions will be in place for British residents who have to move for genuine reasons, such as work or because of a family breakdown.\n\nSpeaking on Sky News, immigration minister Mark Harper said: \"That's one of the issues that really upsets people when they see somebody arrive in the country and they appear to get better treatment than people that have been there for a long time.\"\n\nHe said the government was also looking at immigrants' access to benefits, healthcare and education as well as housing.\n\nChief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: \"If you want a stronger economy, then we need a society that can welcome immigrants to make an economic contribution to our country, that's what I want to see.\n\n\"But we also need to have rules in our immigration system that are seen to be fair, that British people can have confidence in and that's the balance that we're trying to achieve.\"\n\nThe Local Government Association's Mike Jones said immigration and lack of housing were separate issues and that, while there were things the government could do to help, this proposal was \"a bit of a sideshow\".\n\n\"If they are in the country legally then we have a responsibility to do things that are right for people and that's housing,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. \n\n\"Now if we don't house them that means that we are going to have to deal with them under the homeless laws which cost us a great deal more money. So I think it's down to local councils to pick and choose how they can actually deliver the housing need within their areas.\"\n\n'Wholly disproportionate'\n\nMr Cameron's speech on immigration comes days after his deputy prime minister, Mr Clegg, made his biggest intervention to date in the debate, and at a time when concerns have been raised about the potential influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when movement restrictions are loosened at the end of the year.\n\nMr Clegg called for cash deposits of more than \u00a31,000 for some migrants from \"high risk\" countries, to be taken with their visa applications and repaid when they leave the UK.\n\nPoliticians' response to immigration has been described as \"wholly disproportionate\" by the Bishop of Dudley, the Right Reverend David Walker, speaking to the Observer. \n\n\"Public fears around immigration are like fears around crime. They bear little relationship to the actual reality,\" said the bishop, who spent 20 years on the boards of housing associations.\n\n\"The true threats to our national wellbeing lie not with those who come to visit or make their lives here but with the increasing gap between the rich and poor among us.\"\n\nSpeaking later on Radio 4's Sunday programme, he added: \"The reason why people are not getting council housing or housing association properties is not to do with people coming from overseas, it's because governments have failed to build enough social homes and private builders, frankly, at the moment are sitting on land - they're not prepared to build them because it looks better on their balance books undeveloped.\"\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson said the capital and the UK \"benefit hugely\" from attracting talented people from around the world, but it was important to \"strike a balance\".\n\n\"If it is going to make the difference and help us to stop people coming here who want to leech off the system, to put it in crude terms, without damaging our openness to talent then I completely support it,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband recently admitted the last Labour government did not do enough for ordinary people, becoming distant on issues such as immigration.\n\n\"But high levels of migration were having huge effects on the lives of people in Britain - and too often those in power seemed not to accept this,\" he said in January.\n\n\"The fact that they didn't explains partly why people turned against us in the last general election.\"\n\n"

Twitter has intervened more often with deletions and warnings.\n\nBoth social networks have vowed to combat potentially dangerous misinformation around the virus.\n\nBut Mr Trump has taken issue with what he sees as editorialising by the companies. \n\nShortly after Twitter put a warning label on his posts for the first time in May, Mr Trump signed an executive order to repeal Section 230.\n\nThe proposal has attracted cross-party support - but for different reasons.\n\nThe Republicans say there is a bias against or even outright censorship of conservative views online and want this to stop. The Democrats say they are more interested in the spread of misinformation.\n\nLast week, the US Senate Commerce Committee issued subpoenas for the heads of Facebook, Twitter and Google to probe the matter further. \n\nPressure has been mounting on Facebook and Twitter to do more to tackle misinformation both about the pandemic and the US election. For that reason, their decisive action on Trump's recent post promoting false claims about the severity of coronavirus will be welcomed. \n\nThat said, Trump's comments about the flu - and those yesterday saying \"Don't be afraid of Covid\" - have already started to fuel conspiracy theories online. \n\nPosts in pro-Trump and anti-mask Facebook groups have shared the comments with captions about the pandemic not being real, or not very serious. They have also used it to encourage others not to follow health guidance like wearing a mask or social distancing.  \n\nEarly on in the pandemic, the BBC investigated the human cost of misinformation, including those who fell seriously ill because social media posts led them to doubt the reality or severity of the pandemic and ignore advice.  \n\nThe hope will be that this action from social media sites could reduce the risk of that happening - but those who may have already been exposed to this disinformation could be impacted.  \n\nAnd all eyes will be on social media sites to see if they keep up this approach to tackling disinformation - coronavirus, political or otherwise - especially from the US Election candidates as polling day nears. \n\n"

        "text":"Ms Sturgeon confirmed that she will ask the UK government for formal consent by the end of this year.\n\nShe said Westminster had \"no right\" to block the request, and its opposition to indyref2 is \"not sustainable\". \n\nBut she stressed any referendum had to be legal if the result was to be recognised internationally. \n\nShe said this was because her aim was not merely to deliver a referendum - but to deliver independence. \n\nMs Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister, told delegates at the conference in Aberdeen: \"My call is that the referendum must happen next year.\n\n\"And we are getting ready. By the new year, we will have completed our legislative preparations. We are already working to update the independence prospectus.  \n\n\"And I can confirm today that before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt.\"\n\nThe UK government has repeatedly said it will not grant a Section 30 order, which was used to ensure the legality of the independence referendum in 2014 in which Scottish voters opted to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%.\n\nThis has led to calls for Ms Sturgeon to outline a so-called Plan B, with some activists and elected politicians arguing that the SNP winning a majority of Scottish seats in an election would be enough for independence negotiations to begin with the UK government.\n\nOthers have called for an unofficial referendum to be held, similar to the disputed one in Catalonia in 2017 - while the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, has not ruled out the possibility of a legal challenge to the UK's government's position. \n\nBut Ms Sturgeon told the conference that the question should not be what the SNP will do if Westminster refuses to agree to a Section 30. \n\nShe said: \"The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties - what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future? \n\n\"The Westminster refusal is not sustainable. We can already see the cracks appearing.\n\n\"Just like us, they know there is going to be a referendum. And they know that when there is, Scotland will choose independence.\"\n\nHowever, she again stressed that the process \"must be legal\" and must \"allow majority support to be expressed clearly and unambiguously\".\n\nShe added: \"It must have the recognition of the international community. Why? Because our job is not just to deliver a referendum. Our job is to deliver independence.\"\n\nEarly independence referendum 'potentially risky' for SNP\n\nAnalysis by polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice\n\nIt is very clear that the SNP now want an early independence referendum, and they are clearly buoyed up by polls that show something of an increase of support for independence - not least among those who voted Remain.  \n\nBut let's just bear in mind the polls are at best saying 50% support for independence. We're still a very long way from the position that we were told not so long ago that the SNP would want to see opinion polls consistently, over a considerable period of time, saying 60% support before they would take the prospect of another referendum.\n\nHolding an early referendum is potentially a very risky project. In particular, I think there's a crucial question that the circumstance under which a second referendum might actually happen are ones that are perhaps rather different from the current political circumstances.\n\nIf we accept - as Nicola Sturgeon implied - that a referendum is only to happen if we get a hung parliament, well, the hung parliament implies that Boris Johnson no longer prime minister so that reason for independence disappears. \n\nBut also it probably implies that we may have had another referendum on EU membership which might have come up with a different result and therefore Brexit is no longer a potential rallying call for independence.\n\nWhat else did Ms Sturgeon say?\n\nDid she announce any new policies?\n\nMs Sturgeon said the Scottish government would introduce a new law to establish emergency protective orders which would help to ensure that it is the perpetrators of domestic violence rather than the victims who lose their homes. \n\nShe said: \"We need to change the reality that for women and their children, often the only way to escape an abuser is to flee their home. For too many, that results in the victims of abuse becoming homeless.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon also announced that the SNP will scrap non-residential social care charges for all if she is still first minister after the Holyrood election in 2021.\n\nAnd she said her party would pledge to expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds in its election manifesto.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nScottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said the answer from Downing Street to Ms Sturgeon's request for a Section 30 order should be an \"unequivocal no\".\n\nAnd he claimed Ms Sturgeon \"simply wanted to get through what was a potentially hostile conference with a series of vacuous promises which will never be kept, and throw some red meat to the hardliners\".\n\nScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon plan would mean \"more division and uncertainty\" and could result in a hard border between Scotland and England.\n\nAnd Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Deomcrats, said independence would be \"bad for Scotland just like Brexit because breaking up long-term economic partnerships is very hard to do\".\n\n"

        "text":"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nPaul estimates that Jim, aged eight, has been suspended for 135 days of his first four years at school.\n\nHe is among a group of parents set to meet the Department of Education (DE) to highlight the similar problems their autistic children are facing.\n\nThe proportion of children with autism in Northern Irish schools has almost trebled in a decade, according to the Department of Health.\n\nAnd some parents, like Paul, say that means they have to battle to get appropriate support in school for their children.\n\n\"Jim's very curious about the world, he loves knowing how things work and likes to hear other people's thoughts on things,\" he said.\n\n\"His autism is autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) with pathological demand avoidance (PDA).\"\n\n\"The majority of the problem that Jim would present with would be anxiety, so as soon as you give him a direct demand he would experience anxiety and as a result of the anxiety he would start refusing.\"\n\nAutism is a spectrum, which means people with autism can present with different conditions.\n\nSome may need little or no support, but others may need sustained help.\n\nAccording to documents seen by BBC News NI, Jim has been suspended for school for 30 days since 28 March, often for five days at a time.\n\nPaul admits Jim presents challenges and would sometimes lash out at his teachers, but said it was due to his rising anxiety.\n\n\"He would become quite distressed within the classroom environment and, as a result, he would throw something, say certain things and then it moved on to lashing out,\" he said.\n\nJim has a statement which says that he needs a full-time classroom assistant and would learn best in a small group setting like a learning support unit.\n\nHowever, he has also faced expulsion, but Paul said that if staff had the appropriate training about Jim's condition then he could thrive in his current school.\n\n\"The strategies you would use for PDA are different than those you would need for a 'normal' ASD child,\" Paul said.\n\n\"For instance, you avoid using the word 'you' towards Jim.\"\n\n\"If Jim did something well you would turn round and say 'I like what has been done there', instead of 'I like what you did there'.\"\n\n\"We could very clearly see there were patterns to how the situation escalated resulting in Jim getting suspended.\"\n\nPaul is now one of a group of more than 100 parents who are in contact as their autistic children have had similar experiences in school.\n\nTanya George's son 11-year-old son, Niall, has also missed substantial amounts of education in primary school.\n\nHe finally received a diagnosis of ASD in July 2018, just as he finished Primary Six.\n\nHe was then able to go to his mainstream primary for three days a week, with the help of a classroom assistant.\n\nBut Tanya said she was aware that Niall needed support much earlier in his school career, and had often put himself in danger at school.\n\n\"In the past he's got extremely overwhelmed and he's got so stressed that he's had to run out of the room, into fields and in front of cars,\" she said.\n\n\"His flight response is really, really triggered at that point when his anxiety is so great.\n\n\"A child doesn't present like that for no reason.\"\n\n\"Any child that would have those issues you should be looking at helping and supporting and resolving the child to get through it.\"\n\nShe also said that at times she felt pressured to withdraw Niall from school altogether.\n\nTanya said, though, that since receiving a dedicated classroom assistant following his diagnosis and completed statement Niall has progressed and is now looking forward to post-primary school.\n\nThe Education Authority now spends \u00a3270m a year on supporting children with special educational needs - including autism.\n\nThat is around one-eighth of the entire yearly education budget.\n\nDE's permanent secretary Derek Baker has previously said that he is worried about the rising cost and the support offered to children with special educational needs.\n\nAnd according to Liam Mackle from the Children's Law Centre in Belfast an increasing number of parents are challenging the level of support their children are receiving.\n\n\"There are pockets where schools don't yet understand the complexity of autism - each child with autism is completely different from the next child with autism,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about identifying what triggers are, speaking to the experts at the EA in terms of their autism intervention services and putting proper school-based strategies in place to avoid the need for things like suspensions and detentions which aren't addressing the problem.\"\n\n\"Special educational needs and provision for children particularly with autism has really in the last five years, in terms of our advice service, really exploded.\n\n\"Five years ago we were dealing with just under 400 cases in terms of special educational needs - including autism - and that's now jumped to 1600.\"\n\nMr Mackle's experience is borne out by figures from the Department of Justice, which shows that the number of appeals to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal (SENDIST) has more than doubled in recent years.\n\nIn 2015\/16 there were 145 appeals to the tribunal - which rules in cases where parents are unhappy with how the EA is dealing with their child's special educational needs.\n\nBy 2018\/19 that had risen to 378 appeals, and just over half of those cases to reach a hearing were won by the parents.\n\n"

The most famous version of the Great Commission is in Matthew 28:16\u201320, where on a mountain in Galilee Jesus calls on his followers to make disciples of and baptize all nations in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\nThe Great Commission is similar to the episodes of the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles found in the other Synoptic Gospels, though with significant differences. Luke also has Jesus dispatching disciples during his ministry, sending them to all the nations and giving them power over demons, including the seventy disciples. The dispersion of the Apostles in the traditional ending of Mark is thought to be a 2nd-century summary based on Matthew and Luke.\nIt has become a tenet in Christian theology emphasizing ministry, missionary work, evangelism, and baptism. The apostles are said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and founded the apostolic sees. Preterists believe that the Great Commission and other Bible prophecies were fulfilled in the 1st century while futurists believe Bible prophecy is yet to be fulfilled at the Second Coming.\nSome researchers of the historical Jesus[who?] see the Great Commission as reflecting not Jesus' words but rather the Christian community in which each gospel was written. John Dominic Crossan says that Jesus did commission the apostles during his lifetime, as reported in the Gospels. Others,[who?] however, see even these lesser commissions as representing Christian invention rather than history.", "r_dbid": "62dbbb2fee14d50331f60a0f", "r_user": "Hardyplants", "s_page": "Great Commission", "s_revid": "6924920", "s_content": "The Great Commission in Christian belief is something that Jesus told his followers. This happened after His resurrection. Jesus told his Twelve Apostles to go all over the world and tell everyone about Him. The most well known version of the Great Commission is in Matthew 28:16 to 20. Jesus meets his followers on a mountain in Galilee. He tells them to make disciples of and baptize everyone in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\nEarlier Jesus had sent out 70 of his followers to preach and heal, but only to the Jews. However, Jesus himself had healed some non-Jewish people before. At the beginning of his public work, Jesus spoke to His own people. After rising from the dead, he made it clear that His message was for everyone. This \"commission\" is very important to missionaries who believe that God wants them to go to every country in the world and preach about Jesus.", "s_dbid": "62d0f2990c8ef6ef70937d9c", "s_user": "Jonahson", "align_sim": 0.12048192771084337, "cls_score": 0.360321044921875, "categories": [], "annotations": [{"gi": 0, "opis": [1, 0, 3], "category": "discourse_reordering"}, {"gi": 1, "opis": [5, 6, 8], "category": "discourse_reordering"}, {"gi": 2, "opis": [9], "category": "semantic_elaboration_background"}, {"gi": 26, "opis": [19, 17, 16, 14, 13, 11, 10], "category": "discourse_reordering"}, {"gi": 3, "opis": [21, 22], "category": "lexical_generic"}, {"gi": 4, "opis": [24, 26], "category": "discourse_reordering"}, {"gi": 5, "opis": [24, 26, 25], "category": "syntactic_sentence_splitting"}, {"gi": 6, "opis": [28, 29, 30], "category": "syntactic_sentence_splitting"}, {"gi": 7, "opis": [29, 30], "category": "discourse_anaphora_insertion"}, {"gi": 8, "opis": [32, 33], "category": "lexical_generic"}, {"gi": 9, "opis": [35], "category": "syntactic_generic"}, {"gi": 10, "opis": [37, 39], "category": "syntactic_generic"}, {"gi": 11, "opis": [41, 44], "category": "nonsim_extraneous_information"}, {"opis": [42], "category": "semantic_deletion"}, {"gi": 13, "opis": [45], "category": "nonsim_extraneous_information"}, {"gi": 24, "opis": [46], "category": "nonsim_extraneous_information"}, {"opis": [47], "category": "semantic_deletion"}, {"gi": 15, "opis": [49, 50, 52, 53, 56], "category": "nonsim_extraneous_information"}, {"opis": [54], "category": "semantic_deletion"}, {"opis": [57], "category": "semantic_deletion"}, {"opis": [59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], "category": "semantic_deletion"}], "edits": [{"type": "insert", "insert": "The", "N_words": 1, "BI": "B", "idx": 0}, {"type": "delete", "delete": "In Christianity, the", "N_words": 3, "BI": "I", "idx": 1}, {"type": "equal", "text": "Great Commission", "N_words": 2, "BI": "O", "idx": 2}, {"type": "insert", "insert": "in Christian belief", "N_words": 3, "BI": "I", "idx": 3}, {"type": "equal", "text": "is", "N_words": 1, "BI": "O", "idx": 4}, {"type": "insert", "insert": "something that", "N_words": 2, "BI": "B", "idx": 5}, {"type": "delete", "delete": "the instruction of the resurrected", "N_words": 5, "BI": "I", "idx": 6}, {"type": "equal", "text": "Jesus", "N_words": 1, "BI": "O", "idx": 7}, {"type": "insert", "insert": "told his followers.", "N_words": 3, "BI": "I", "idx": 8}, {"type": "insert", "insert": " This happened after His resurrection.", "N_words": 6, "BI": "B", "idx": 9}, {"type": "insert", "insert": " Jesus told his Twelve Apostles", "N_words": 6, "BI": "B", "idx": 10}, {"type": "delete", "delete": "Christ", "N_words": 1, "BI": "I", "idx": 11}, {"type": "equal", "text": "to", "N_words": 1, "BI": "O", "idx": 12}, {"type": "insert", "insert": "go", "N_words": 1, "BI": "I", "idx": 13}, {"type": "delete", "delete": "his disciples to spread the gospel to", "N_words": 7, "BI": "I", "idx": 14}, {"type": "equal", "text": "all", "N_words": 1, "BI": "O", "idx": 15}, {"type": "insert", "insert": "over", "N_words": 1, "BI": "I", "idx": 16}, {"type": "delete", "delete": "the nations of", "N_words": 3, "BI": "I", "idx": 17}, {"type": "equal", "text": "the world", "N_words": 2, "BI": "O", "idx": 18}, {"type": "insert", "insert": "and tell everyone about Him", "N_words": 5, "BI": "I", "idx": 19}, {"type": "equal", "text": ".

ground. Various guns and cannons have been used in this role since the first military aircraft were used in World War I, growing in power and accuracy over the years. Starting in the post-World War II era the guns were joined by the guided missile, specifically the \"surface-to-air missile\", and today both are used in combination in most roles. Adaptations of standard artillery systems were commonly used for most long-range anti-aircraft artillery, starting with standard pieces on new mountings, and evolving to custom guns with much higher performance prior to World War II. Their shells are usually fitted with different types of fuses (barometric, time-delay, or proximity) to send exploding metal fragments into the area of the target. The classic example of a large calibre, long-range anti-aircraft gun is the German 88 mm gun. Long-range weapons of this sort have for the most part been superseded by the effective anti-air missile systems that were introduced in the 1950s; however, because they are relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture compared to more modern systems, they are still employed in large numbers by many nations.\nFor shorter-range work, a lighter weapon with a higher rate of fire is required, to guarantee a hit on a quickly traversing target. Weapons of 20 mm, 37 mm, and 40 mm have been widely used in this role. Unlike the heavier guns, these smaller weapons are still in widespread use today for the same reasons as they were originally introduced: the ability to quickly follow the target. Modern systems often use weapons generally known as autocannon, that were originally intended for air-to-ground use. However, developments in the latest short-range missiles means that these appear to be able to replace guns even in this role.\nNicknames for anti-aircraft guns include AAA or triple-A, an abbreviation for anti-aircraft artillery, ack-ack (from the World War I phonetic alphabet for AA), archie (a WWI British term believed to derive via the Royal Flying Corps from the music-hall comedian George Robey's line \"Archibald, certainly not!\"), and flak or flack (from the German Flugabwehrkanone, aircraft defense cannon).[ An anti-aircraft missile is another name for a surface-to-air missile, abbreviated and pronounced SAM.\nThe United States Navy uses the term Anti-Air Warfare (AAW); most groups of ships have a designated AAW commander among them. The Soviet Anti-Air Defense was a separate armed service, but in Russia has been subordinated to the Air Force. The United States Army has generally been able to count on air superiority to reduce the threat from air attack on its ground units, and settles for a two-tier structure: the man-portable Stinger missile (fired by troops or from vehicles) and the anti-aircraft/anti-missile Patriot system. Countries less assured of air superiority have more tiers. Russia, for example, has a system consisting of battalion-level MANPADS, regimental SHORAD (typically autocannon and IR/SACLOS SAMs), divisional SHORAD (typically short-ranged radar guided SAMs), medium range Army level (SA-11) and long range Front level (SA-12) systems.", "r_dbid": "62d0acba1bbc6dcde5b776d3", "r_user": "Rillian", "s_page": "Anti-aircraft warfare", "s_revid": "509832", "s_content": "Anti-aircraft warfare, or air defence, is any way of fighting military aircraft in combat from the ground.

Sickle-cell anaemia is also referred to as \"HbSS\", \"SS disease\", \"haemoglobin S\" or permutations thereof. In heterozygous people, who have only one sickle gene and one normal adult haemoglobin gene, it is referred to as \"HbAS\" or \"sickle cell trait\". Other, rarer forms of sickle-cell disease include sickle-haemoglobin C disease (HbSC), sickle beta-plus-thalassaemia (HbS/\u03b2+) and sickle beta-zero-thalassaemia (HbS/\u03b20). These other forms of sickle-cell disease are compound heterozygous states in which the person has only one copy of the mutation that causes HbS and one copy of another abnormal haemoglobin allele.\nThe term disease is applied, because the inherited abnormality causes a pathological condition that can lead to death and severe complications.

It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), who developed a similar temperature scale two years before his death. The degree Celsius (\u00b0C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. The unit was known until 1948 as centigrade.\nFrom 1744 until 1954, 0\u00a0\u00b0C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100\u00a0\u00b0C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere with mercury being the working material Although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement the unit \"degree Celsius\" and the Celsius scale are currently defined by two different points: absolute zero, and the triple point of VSMOW (specially prepared water). This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale, which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature (symbol: K). Absolute zero, the hypothetical but unattainable temperature at which matter exhibits zero entropy, is defined as being precisely 0\u00a0K and \u2212273.15\u00a0\u00b0C. The temperature value of the triple point of water is defined as being precisely 273.16\u00a0K and 0.01\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThis definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part in 273.16 parts, the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water. Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same.

It was ruled by the Rurik dynasty, who had ruled Rus' since the foundation of Novgorod in 862. Ivan III the Great titled himself as Grand Prince of all Rus'.\nThe state originated with the rule of Alexander Nevsky of the Rurik dynasty, when in 1263 his son Daniel I was appointed to rule the newly-created Grand Principality of Moscow, which was a vassal state to the Mongol Empire (under the \"Tatar Yoke\"), and which had eclipsed and eventually absorbed its parent duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal by the 1320s. It later annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1478 and conquered the Grand Duchy of Tver in 1485, and ultimately remained vassal state of the Golden Horde until 1480, though there were frequent uprisings and successful military campaigns against the Mongols, such as the war of Dmitri Donskoi in 1380.\nMuscovites, Suzdalians and other inhabitants of the Rus' principality were able to maintain their Slavic, pagan, and Orthodox traditions for the most part under the Tatar Yoke. Ivan III further consolidated the state during his 43-year reign, campaigning against his major remaining rival power, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and by 1503 he had tripled the territory of his realm, adopting the title of tsar and claiming the title of \"Ruler of all Rus'\". By his marriage to Sophia Palaiologina, niece of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Byzantine emperor, he claimed Muscovy to be the successor state of the Roman Empire, the \"Third Rome\". The emigration of Byzantine people influenced and strengthened Moscow's identity as the heir of Orthodox traditions. Ivan's successor Vasili III also enjoyed military success, gaining Smolensk from Lithuania in 1512 and pushing Muscovy's borders to the Dniepr River. Vasili's son Ivan IV (later known as Ivan the Terrible) was an infant upon his father's death in 1533. He was crowned in 1547, assuming the title of tsar together with the proclamation of the Tsardom of Russia (Russian: \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u0443\u0441c\u043a\u043e\u0435, Tsarstvo Russkoye).", "r_dbid": "62d2827f11049d022625d1af", "r_user": "Lembit Staan", "s_page": "Grand Duchy of Moscow", "s_revid": "8091964", "s_content": "The Grand Duchy of Moscow, Muscovite Russia, Muscovite Rus' or Grand Principality of Moscow (Russian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435, romanized:\u00a0Velikoye knyazhestvo Moskovskoye; or Muscovy in English from the Latin Moscovia) was a principality in Rus'.

Methanol acquired the name \"wood alcohol\" because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood. Modern methanol is produced in a catalytic industrial process directly from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\nMethanol is the simplest alcohol, and is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol (drinking alcohol). However, unlike ethanol, methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption. At room temperature, it is a polar liquid, and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethanol. It is also used for producing biodiesel via transesterification reaction.\nMethanol is produced naturally in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria, and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment. As a result, there is a small fraction of methanol vapor in the atmosphere. Over the course of several days, atmospheric methanol is oxidized with the help of sunlight to carbon dioxide and water.\nMethanol burns in oxygen, including open air, forming carbon dioxide and water:\nMethanol ingested in large quantities is metabolized to formic acid or formate salts, which is poisonous to the central nervous system, and may cause blindness, coma, and death. Because of these toxic properties, methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses.

Jayeshbhai Jordaar was earlier announced to release in theatres on 2 October 2020 and later 27 August 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic in India led to its postponement by the makers who waited for the pandemic to subside rather than releasing it on OTT platforms.

He previously served as Ollanta Humala's Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015, and Prime Minister from April 2015 to July 2016.\nBorn in the capital city of Lima in 1958, Cateriano pursued a law degree at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, specializing in constitutional law. During his brief term in the Peruvian Congress between 1990 and 1992, Cateriano attained a prominent role as a ranking member of the congressional investigative committee on Alan Garc\u00eda's first administration (1985-1990). Alongside Lourdes Flores and Fernando Olivera, the committee was ultimately disbanded following Garc\u00eda's acquittal by the Supreme Court in March 1992. Cateriano published in the following years a detailed work on the investigation.\nAfter a failed run for the Peruvian Congress, Cateriano worked extensively in opposition to Alberto Fujimori's presidency, ultimately being appointed to the Constitutional Reform Advisory Body of the Ministry of Justice in the presidency of Valent\u00edn Paniagua. Subsequently, he was appointed under Alejandro Toledo's presidency as Deputy Minister of Justice, serving until his resignation in June 2002, alongside minister and former colleague, Fernando Olivera.\nDuring the presidency of Ollanta Humala, Cateriano served as Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015. In his almost three-year tenure, he remained a controversial member of Humala's administration, constantly clashing with the opposition regarding the government's modus operandi, in which First Lady Nadine Heredia seemingly interfered with government decisions. He also faced criticism for his support of pecuniary sanctions on voluntary military service enrollment, which the Constitutional Court declared the measure unconstitutional. Upon the resignation of Ana Jara on 2 April 2015, due to her censorship by the Peruvian Congress regarding illegal government espionage under her management as Prime Minister of Peru, Cateriano was appointed as her successor. Seemed by pundits as a government loyalist, he served through the end of Humala's presidency.\nCateriano was sworn as Prime Minister of Peru on 15 July 2020, succeeding Vicente Zeballos as the government faces strong criticism due to Vizcarra's management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru.", "r_dbid": "62d1755670a3472b808e9968", "r_user": "", "s_page": "Pedro Cateriano", "s_revid": "7035387", "s_content": "Pedro \u00c1lvaro Cateriano Bellido (born June 26, 1958) is a Peruvian lawyer and politician.

Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was referred to as the NASCAR Winston Cup Series (1971\u20132003). A similar deal was made with Nextel in 2003, and it became the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series (2004\u20132007). Sprint acquired Nextel in 2005, and in 2008 the series was renamed the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series (2008\u20132016). In December 2016, it was announced that Monster Energy would become the new title sponsor and the series was renamed the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (2017\u20132019). In 2019, NASCAR rejected Monster's offer to extend the current naming rights deal beyond the end of the season. NASCAR subsequently announced its move to a new tiered sponsorship model beginning with the 2020 season similar to other US based professional sports leagues, where it was simply known as the NASCAR Cup Series, with the sponsors of the series being called Premier Partners.

The season is divided into two segments. After the first 26 races, 16 drivers, selected primarily on the basis of wins during the first 26 races, are seeded based on their total number of wins. They compete in the last ten races, where the difference in points is greatly minimized. This is called the NASCAR playoffs.\nThe series holds strong roots in the Southeastern United States, with about half of the races in the 36-race season being held in that region. As of 2020[update] the schedule includes tracks from around the United States. Regular season races were previously held in Canada, and exhibition races were held in Japan and Australia.

It is usually larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town or city. Villages have been the normal unit of community living in most areas of the world throughout its history, up until the Industrial revolution and the ongoing process of urbanization. In many U.S. states, a village is a type of municipal government (see below).\nAlthough many types and organizational patterns of village life have existed, the typical village was small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families. Homes were situated together for sociability and defense, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed.\nIn England the main historical distinction between a hamlet and a village is that the latter will have a church, and will therefore usually have been the worship centre of a parish. A village is traditionally distinguished from a town because a village lacks a regular market.\nThere is much dispute over which is the largest village in England. Places claiming to be the largest include Cranleigh in Surrey, Cottingham in the East Riding of Yorkshire, both Haddenham and Wendover in Buckinghamshire, Braunton in Devon, Birchington in Kent, Horsforth in West Yorkshire, Street in Somerset, Bembridge on the Isle of Wight, Ruskington in Lincolnshire and Kidlington in Oxfordshire.\nIn many parts of the United States, for example New York and Vermont, the term \"village\" refers to a specific form of incorporated local government, similar to a city but with less authority and geographic scope. However, this is a generality; in many states such as Illinois, there are villages that are an order of magnitude larger than the smallest cities in the state. The distinction is not based on population, but on the relative powers granted to the different types of municipalities and correspondingly, different obligations to provide specific services to residents. Villages in New York are often physically within a town and may be coterminous with it, but in other cases may be in two towns or even two counties).

Any partial solution that contains two mutually attacking queens can be aon. It is useless, for example, for locating a given value in an unordered table. When it is applicable, however, backtracking is often much faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate a large number of candidates with a single test.\nBacktracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is often the most convenient (if not the most efficient) technique for parsing, for the knapsack problem and other combinatorial optimization problems. It is also the basis of the so-called logic programming languages such as Icon, Planner and Prolog.\nBacktracking depends on user-given \"black box procedures\" that define the problem to be solved, the nature of the partial candidates, and how they are extended into complete candidates. It is therefore a metaheuristic rather than a specific algorithm\u00a0\u2013 although, unlike many other meta-heuristics, it is guaranteed to find all solutions to a finite problem in a bounded amount of time.\nThe term \"backtrack\" was coined by American mathematician D.

During the war, France and its client states under Napoleon I defeated an alliance, the Third Coalition, made up of the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, Britain and others.\nBritain had already been at war with France following the resumption of hostilities resulting from the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens and remained the only country still at war with France after the Treaty of Pressburg. From 1803\u201305, Britain stood under constant threat of a French invasion. The Royal Navy, however, secured mastery of the seas and decisively destroyed a Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805.\nThe Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804\u201305 as Napoleon's actions in Italy (crowning himself with the Iron Crown of Lombardy) and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the Duc d'Enghien) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the Grande Arm\u00e9e lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Russo-Austrian force under Tsar Alexander I at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\nOn 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties between the two powers of Campo Formio and of Lun\u00e9ville. The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy and Bavaria to France and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also permitted the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and central Europe. As a direct consequence of these events, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist when, in 1806, Holy Roman Emperor Francis\u00a0II abdicated the Imperial throne, emerging as Francis I, Emperor of Austria. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Austerlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose armies protected Sicily from a French invasion, to settle.

However, after the outbreak of the Wars of the Diadochi in 322, Perdiccas' military failures against Ptolemy in Egypt led to the mutiny of his troops in Pelusium. Perdiccas was betrayed and assassinated in a conspiracy by Seleucus, Peithon and Antigenes in Pelusium sometime in either 321 or 320 BC.\nAt the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Seleucus was appointed Satrap of Babylon under the new regent Antipater. But almost immediately, the wars between the Diadochi resumed and Antigonus[D] forced Seleucus to flee Babylon. Seleucus was only able to return to Babylon in 312 BC with the support of Ptolemy. From 312 BC, Seleucus ruthlessly expanded his dominions and eventually conquered the Persian and Median lands.

Pernik is the most populated town in western Bulgaria after Sofia. It is the main town of Pernik Province and lies on both banks of the Struma River in the Pernik Valley between the Golo Bardo Mountain, Vitosha Mountain, Lyulin and Viskyar mountains.\nPernik is the principal town of Pernik Province \u2013 a province in western Bulgaria, which is next to the Serbian border.\nOriginally the site of a Thracian fortress founded in the 4th century BC, and later a Roman settlement, Pernik became part of the Bulgarian Empire in the early 9th century as an important fortress. The medieval town was a key Bulgarian stronghold during Bulgarian tsar Samuil's wars against the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century, when it was governed by the local noble Krakra of Pernik, withstanding Byzantine sieges a number of times.\nFrom 1396 until 1878 the town was under Ottoman rule. In the 20th century Pernik developed rapidly as a centre for coal mining and heavy industry. During the Communist rule of Bulgaria it was called Dimitrovo between 1949 and 1962 after Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov.\nThe Surva International Festival of the Masquerade Games (simply called Surva) is held in the town every January. Surva is an International Kukeri Festival in Pernik, Bulgaria and is one of the biggest masquerade festival on the Balkans and Eastern Europe. It is held in the last three days of January each year.\nEconomically Pernik is an industrial town. Industry is of vital importance for the economy of the province. Pernik is the major manufacturing centre, one of the largest in the country with the Stomana steel complex; heavy machinery (mining and industrial equipment); brown coals, building materials and textiles being the most important. Near Pernik there is an enormous plant for heavy machinery in smaller town Radomir which produces excavators and industrial equipment, but is currently not working at full capacity.\nPernik has two football teams, PFC Minyor Pernik and FC Metalurg Pernik.", "r_dbid": "62d372c770a3472b809a3205", "r_user": "5.53.149.214", "s_page": "Pernik", "s_revid": "8147284", "s_content": "Pernik (Bulgarian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a) is a city in western Bulgaria, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of the capital Sofia.

In 1977 he played for Independiente Rivadavia, but returned to Ferro the next season. With Ferro he obtained the first division Nacional 1982 and Nacional 1984. He also played for the Argentina national football team, but didn't participate in the World Cup. In 1988 he transferred to Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n, were he played until his retirement in 1992.\nC\u00faper started his coaching career in Hurac\u00e1n, a year and a half after his retirement. After three years he moved to Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas, and two years later he made the jump to Europe. In 1997 he was hired by RCD Mallorca, and in the very first season he drove the modest club to the final of the Copa del Rey, which he would lose against FC Barcelona. The following season the team reached the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup losing to S.S. Lazio. However, in the same season the team had its revenge against Barcelona, winning the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a in 1998. That season also meant the best historical position at the end of the league with a 3rd place, allowing the team to play in the UEFA Champions League.\nC\u00faper moved to the Valencia CF in 1999, where he maintained his bad luck in finals, losing the final of the Champions League two consecutive times; in 2000 against Real Madrid, and in 2001 with FC Bayern Munich by penalty kicks.\nIn 2001 C\u00faper was hired by Italian club Inter Milan, where he reached the third and second place of the championship in successive seasons. His poor luck with champions league continued when his team lost the semifinals of UEFA Champions League 2002-03 to city rivals A.C. Milan on away goals rule. He was fired from the club after six matches in 2003, when the team was in the 8th position.\nAfter a year off work, due to a contractual argument with Inter, C\u00faper managed Mallorca again during the 2004/05 season, when the team was already in a relegation position after 10 matches, saving the team from relegation in the last match of the season. Suffering bad results in spite of his many signings, C\u00faper decided to leave the team in February 2006, with the team at the bottom of the division.\nHe started the 2007\u201308 season at the helm of Real Betis, but was sacked on December 2, 2007 following his side's loss against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. On March 11, 2008 he was unveiled as new boss of relegation-battling Serie A team Parma, replacing Domenico Di Carlo at the helm of the giallobl\u00f9.", "r_dbid": "62d0af1a1bbc6dcde5bfb58b", "r_user": "190.11.148.200", "s_page": "H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper", "s_revid": "1315144", "s_content": "H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper (born 16 November, 1955) is a former Argentine football player.

The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.\nThe Mummy opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43\u00a0million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; the movie went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, The Mummy Returns, as well as The Mummy: The Animated Series, and the spin-off film The Scorpion King.

It has since hosted the 2016 and 2017 finals featuring Toronto FC, under the current practice of giving home field advantage to the side with the better regular season record. The venue has also hosted rugby union, including matches of Canada's national team, and rugby sevens during the 2015 Pan-American Games.\nFrom 2014 to 2016, the stadium underwent a series of major renovations, which added an upper deck to the east grandstand, a roof over the seating areas and lengthened the field to make it suitable for hosting Canadian football. The latter allowed for the Toronto Argonauts to move to BMO Field beginning with the 2016 CFL season, which also saw the 104th Grey Cup played at the stadium.", "r_dbid": "62d0dc9d11049d02261c43bf", "r_user": "Leventio", "s_page": "BMO Field", "s_revid": "7135716", "s_content": "BMO Field is an outdoor stadium located at Exhibition Place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

South Ledge, which is 2.2 nautical miles (4.1\u00a0km; 2.5\u00a0mi) to the south-south-west of Pedra Branca, is a rock formation visible only at low-tide.\nPedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries. It was originally within the territory of the Johor Sultanate which was founded in 1528, and remained under the new Sultanate of Johor under the British sphere of influence following the signing of the Anglo\u2013Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Between 1850 and 1851, the British built Horsburgh Lighthouse on the island without informing the Johor authorities of their decision to do so or seeking consent for its erection. From that time, the island was administered by the United Kingdom and its successor, Singapore. On 21 September 1953, the Acting State Secretary of Johor, responding to a query from the Colonial Secretary of Singapore about the status of the island, stated that \"the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca\".\nOn 21 December 1979 Malaysia published a map which showed the island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together with the issue of sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, was presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions which demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.", "r_dbid": "62d10d4911049d02261d6c74", "r_user": "Chelva28", "s_page": "Pedra Branca, Singapore", "s_revid": "4383883", "s_content": "Pedra Branca, also known as Pulau Batu Puteh and Batu Puteh, is an small island at the western edge of the South China Sea.

The stadium can seat 150,000, which is the largest non-auto racing stadium capacity in the world.\nIts name comes from Rungra Island in the Taedong River, upon which it is situated, and May Day, the international day celebrating labour and particularly celebrated among communists. Its scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and it is said to resemble a parachute or a magnolia blossom. It is not to be confused with the nearby large Kim Il-sung Stadium.\nIt hosts events on a main pitch sprawling across over 22,500\u00a0m\u00b2 (242,200\u00a0ft\u00b2).

These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September.

Organisms that reproduce sexually must solve the problem of generating an entire organism from just the germ cells.\nSo long as reproduction simply means one cell copying itself, true multicellularity cannot exist. Therefore, sexual reproduction and the ability of gametes to develop into an organism is the necessary antecedent to true multicellularity.

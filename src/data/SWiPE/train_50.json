More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power, some for several days. At least 151 people were killed directly or indirectly.\nAlthough state officials including Republican governor Greg Abbott initially blamed the outages on frozen wind turbines and solar panels, inadequately winterized natural gas equipment was the primary cause. Also, Texas had isolated its power grid from the two major national grids in an effort to avoid federal oversight and deregulate its energy sector, making it difficult for the state to import electricity from other states.\nThe crisis drew much attention to the state's lack of preparedness for such storms, and to a report from U.S. Federal regulators ten years earlier that had warned Texas its power plants would fail in sufficiently cold conditions. Damages from the blackouts were estimated at over $195 billion, surpassing Hurricane Harvey as the costliest disaster in Texas history. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Texas power grid was \"seconds or minutes away from\" complete failure when partial grid shutdowns were implemented. During the crisis, some energy firms made billions in profits, while others went bankrupt, due to some firms being able to pass extremely high wholesale prices ($9,000/MWh, typically $50/MWh) on to consumers, while others could not, as well as this price being held at the $9,000 cap by ERCOT for allegedly two days longer than necessary; creating $16 billion in unnecessary charges.", "r_dbid": "62dbcbe2ee14d50331fb8527", "r_user": "Ari T.

The crisis was caused by a massive electricity generation failure in the state of Texas; and caused shortages of water, food, and heat.\nMore than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power, some for several days. At least 151 people were killed. The total damage is estimated to be between $100 billion and $200 billion, making it as expensive as Hurricane Harvey and other major disasters.\nThe Texas crisis's proximate causes were two unanticipated shocks induced from the sub-zero temperatures (\u20112\u02da F in Dallas): a failure of conventional (thermal) generating supply, mostly from lack of natural gas, and a surge in electricity demand. Inadequate winterization caused freezing of the gas supply and many plants' control instruments. In a system with a winter peak of 66 GW, about 30 GW of thermal plants were unavailable. In its worst-case extreme-winter analysis, ERCOT had expected a loss of 14 GW of thermal resources. The February storm caused more than double the anticipated thermal outages.\nSimultaneously, electric heaters created a powerful surge in demand. About 61% of Texans rely on electric heat, mostly low-efficiency resistance heat, in poorly insulated homes \u2014 a seemingly sensible choice in a warm climate with cheap electricity, where home heating is often unnecessary. The demand surge caused by the cold came to about 20 GW or one-third of the winter peak. ERCOT based its worst-case analysis on a 2011 winter storm, the most severe cold-weather event in Texas in twenty years. The 2021 storm was much worse than that of 2011.

Ouch! Erik Meldik screamed in pain as he tried to pull himself free after being glued to a chair by his girlfriend . Dominika Petrinova decided to get her painful revenge by gluing wax strips to the plastic chair after her boyfriend's previous prank where he told her that their pet dog called Sam was in the washing machine . So Ms Petrinova had decided to exact her revenge in a painful prank of her own. This hilarious video shows her setting up the gag by super gluing the waxing strips to a plastic office chair. She then cruelly promised her boyfriend, who had celebrated his birthday the day before, a special treat. Ms Petrinova then led him - naked and blindfolded - into the room and onto the booby-trapped chair. After cruelly telling him she has a birthday surprise in store, Ms Petrinova blindfolds her naked boyfriend before getting him to sit down on the booby-trapped seat .

But Ms Petrinova said she had decided the dog in the washing machine stunt was too much, and wanted to teach her boyfriend a painful lesson that he would not forget in a hurry. She said: 'I was really upset when I thought Sam was in the washing machine, and he was running after me saying he was sorry but he clearly wasn't because he was filming it and put it all online. 'Well, now I am pretty sure he is genuinely sorry.' He screams as he uses a set of drawers to try and yank himself off the strips which are stuck to his genitals . He finally pulls himself free leaving behind a fair portion of skin behind on the waxing strips in the process .

Local Leeton parents have expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids.

This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. The 26-year-old Leeton High School teacher was allegedly murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years.

The USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy left the Persian Gulf on Sunday and are steaming through the Arabian Sea and heading towards Yemen. The vessels are believed to be joining other U.S. ships that are poised to intercept any Iranian ships carrying weapons to the Houthi rebels fighting in Yemen. The Navy has been beefing up its presence in the Gulf of Aden and the southern Arabian Sea amid reports that about eight Iranian ships are heading toward Yemen and possibly carrying arms. The USS Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (background), was dispatched to the Gulf of Aden to blockade an Iranian flotilla carrying arms. The carrier is pictured here with the USS Vicksburg cruiser - similar to the USS Normandy which was also sent to the Gulf of Aden . The guided missile cruiser USS Normandy is pictured here. The cruiser is escorting the Roosevelt to the Gulf of Aden . Navy officials said there are about nine U.S. warships in the region, including cruisers and destroyers carrying teams that can board and search other vessels. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ship movement on the record. But speaking to Reuters on Monday, a Pentagon spokesman  denied the ships were on a mission to intercept Iranian arms shipments. One U.S. official said the presence of the U.S. warships off Yemen give American decision-makers options for action in the event the situation deteriorates. The other U.S. warships in the region include two destroyers, two mine-sweepers and three amphibious ships carrying 2,200 U.S. Marines. The Shi'ite Muslim Houthi are battling government-backed fighters in an effort to take control of the country. The Houthi fighters sidelined the central government after seizing the capital Sana'a in September and expanding across Yemen, which borders oil giant Saudi Arabia. Closing in: The USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy left the Persian Gulf on Sunday (seen on the map) and are heading through the Arabian Sea towards Yemen, according to reports . The U.S. has been providing logistical and intelligence support to a Saudi Arabia-led coalition, which has been launching airstrikes against the Houthis. That air campaign is now in its fourth week. The U.S. Navy generally conducts consensual boardings of ships when needed, including to combat piracy around Africa and the region. So far, however, U.S. naval personnel have not boarded any Iranian vessels since the Yemen conflict began. White House spokesman Josh Earnest would not comment specifically on any Navy movements in Yemeni waters, but said the U.S. has concerns about Iran's 'continued support for the Houthis'. 'We have seen evidence that the Iranians are supplying weapons and other armed support to the Houthis in Yemen,' he said. 'That support will only contribute to greater violence in that country. 'These are exactly the kind of destabilizing activities that we have in mind when we raise concerns about Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East.' He said 'the Iranians are acutely aware of our concerns for their continued support of the Houthis by sending them large shipments of weapons'.",

When Sally Lutkin decided to have her grandchildren's names tattooed on her leg, she imagined ending up with a beautiful, life-long reminder of her loved ones. Instead, she was left with a gruesome black hole and a lasting scar in the middle of her calf, after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. Mrs Lutkin, 49, had a rose surrounded by the names grandchildren Harvey, seven, Harvey Junior, six, and Cooper, one, tattooed above her left ankle in November 2013. But the tattoo quickly became so swollen that she was in agony and couldn't walk, forcing her to rush to A&E. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to stop the infection spreading to her bone. She was left with a bloody hole resembling a gunshot in the middle of her rose design, as well as an unsightly scar she will have to live with for years. Mrs Lutkin, of Kingston upon Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'It really upset me because it's something that I wanted just for me - and it really didn't turn out that way. 'I was in the hospital for a week and it was so difficult because it's the longest I've ever been away from my babies. 'They had to operate before the infection spread down to the bone and I don't know what would have happened if they had not caught it earlier. 'The pain was horrendous - it was indescribable. I was in agony and the swelling was so bad that I couldn't walk.' Her daughter Laura, 28, noticed that the tattoo was turning red the day after the needle work was complete. But Mrs Lutkin, who works as a cleaner, dismissed it as a normal part of the healing process. She was horrified when the symptoms worsened and her leg began to swell until she could no longer walk. Her  husband Peter, 57, a labourer, rushed her to hospital and she remained there for a week while she battled the nightmare infection. Mrs Lutkin, who has five children, admitted that even 18 months later she is still feeling the effects of the infection. Mrs Lutkin wanted a tattoo of a rose and her grandchildren's names (Harvey, seven, is pictured, left). But it became infected and after an emergency operation she was left with a gruesome hole in her leg (right) She has been left with a scar even 18 months after the ordeal, and has vowed never to have another tattoo again in her life . She said: 'I still get aches and pains from it but I just have to get on with my life. 'We're a really close family and they were shocked. 'It was a hard thing for them to see me in so much pain, especially for my eldest grandkids. 'It ruined Christmas because I couldn't go out Christmas shopping and all the little ones wanted to put the decorations up - in the end, my kids had to put them up for me.' The ordeal forced her to abandon plans to add the names of one-year-olds Lottie and Harper - who were born within six days of one another - to the body art. And, with another grandchild on the way, Mrs Lutkin insists she is not tempted to tamper with ink any more. She said: 'It's put me off for life. I'd had tattoos before but I'll never have one again. 'I won't even risk getting the tattoo removed. 'No one is laying their hands on me ever again after this.'

But a court in the country's capital Cairo acquitted the 63-year-old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty. Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges, with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi (pictured at an court appearance in December) has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012 . But the court cleared the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo. Defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, came to power following the 2011 ouster of  Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising. But after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail. Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected. 'This is a surprise... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder,' Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes, told AFP. Buses were set ablaze during 2012 clashes between opponents and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . 'But the sentences are not bad. We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different,' he said. A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years. Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called 'unprecedented in recent history'. Earlier this month, a Cairo court  confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence. The Brotherhood had called for protests in support of Morsi on Tuesday. 'The coup commander is exploiting the judiciary,' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict, referring to Sisi. It said the president was using the courts 'as a weapon in the battle against the popular will and the democratic and revolutionary legitimacy represented by President Mohamed Morsi.' Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers. Verdicts in those two cases are due on May 16. Sisi has vowed to 'eradicate' the Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's presidential election victory in May 2012. Supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood clashed during 2012 street battles in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . The authorities designated it a 'terrorist group' in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms. The crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups, who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces. Officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since Morsi was overthrown. Sisi was elected president in May last year, but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by Mubarak's ouster of a civilian democracy. Sisi's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth. But Sisi has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. In November, a court dropped murder charges against Mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011.",

Gaston Pinsard was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after he admitted carrying out the  assaults  more than 50 years ago. The 96-year-old, who claimed he was himself abused at a notorious Jersey children's home, first targeted his victims when they were just five-years-old. Frail Gaston Pinsard, 96, is thought to be Britain's oldest serving prison . A judge branded the historic case 'distressing' and 'unpleasant' as he jailed the frail father-of-four. Guernsey's Royal Court heard that Pinsard was born in 1919 and claimed he had endured years sexual abuse at the Haut de la Garenne children's home. The Jersey home came under intense scrutiny in 2008 after police took statements from 192 alleged victims of historic child abuse. Pinsard joined the army after leaving Haut de La Garenne, where he realised his sexual outlook and experiences were different to other peoples. The court heard he later indecently assaulted the two young girls through curiosity and naivety. The abuse began in 1951, and the court was told the victims did not report what was happening because they were too young to understand what was happening and that they trusted Mr Pinsard. He was first questioned by Guernsey Police officers last year and immediately confessed to carrying out the abuse over a nine year period. The court heard how Pinsard touched the first girl on numerous occasions between 1951 and 1955, and the second between 1964 and 1969 at his home in St Sampson, Guernsey. In a statement read out in court Mr Pinsard admitted he felt ashamed and knew at the time what he was doing was wrong but he could not control it. Pinsard was married with four children at the time of the offences, which took place over a period of nine years and only stopped when he decided to 'stop his filthy habit'. He explained to the court how he 'didn't want to hurt any children'. His wife has now passed away, but Pinsard was accompanied to court by his son. At an earlier hearing the defendant, who uses a hearing aid, admitted nine charges of indecent assault. The Haut de La Garenne children's home in Jersey, where the paedophile claims he was abused as a young boy . Pinsard's defence asked the court to exercise extreme caution, suggesting it would be difficult for the prison to accommodate his needs and medication. In sentencing, Judge Russell Finch acknowledged it was 'a difficult situation' and took his age and health into account, stating that a younger man would have received between seven and nine years. Accounting for the risk of the defendant becoming ill and dying in Prison, Mr Finch sentenced Pinsard to two 18-month sentences in Les Nicolles prison, which will run concurrently. The Prison Officers Association have said they believed Pinsard is the oldest serving prisoner in the British Isles. Pinsard was jailed for 18 months by Judge Russell Finch at Guernsey's Royal Court (pictured)",

    "input": "Ian Walters, 51, allegedly killed his wife Tracy by deliberately driving their truck into a tree at 84mph . A church treasurer accused of murdering his wife deliberately veered his 4x4 off the M1 causing it to explode as it hit trees, a court heard today. Leicester Crown Court was told that two dogs and suitcases were also thrown out of the pick-up truck being driven by Ian Walters as it crashed into a line of trees near Markfield, Leicestershire. Yesterday the court was told that his wife, Tracy Walters, died after making a flurry of calls to police about sex-obsessed husband in the days leading up to the M1 crash, including one that morning. Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse. Walters, 51, denies the murder of his wife, who died in hospital two days after the high-speed crash. A jury of nine women and three men was told yesterday that Walters, of  Swindon, was returning home with his wife from a 'make-or-break' week away in North Yorkshire which ended in an argument. Giving evidence to the second day of Walters' trial, several witnesses described how passing motorists went to aid the couple, both trapped in the wreckage of the 4x4. The first witness, Robin Goss, told jurors the driver of the pick-up appeared to have made a 'conscious, deliberate' decision to steer towards the hard shoulder. Mr Goss, a 39-year-old training consultant from Buckinghamshire, told jurors he was up to 150 metres behind the L200, doing around 70mph in the inside lane. 'Everything was normal,' Mr Goss told the court. 'Then all of a sudden I saw this car just swerve violently across to the left. 'It completely disappeared and I remember looking into the hard shoulder. Then I saw what looked like a little explosion. 'Bits of tree and bits of plastic came out in front of me. When I saw the dogs, I started to put together what had happened.' Child protection worker Gary Donald, who was driving a Kia Picanto on the southbound carriageway, also gave evidence to the court about the crash on March 21 last year. He told jurors he saw the pick-up veer sharply from right to left - performing 'almost a straight turn' - and move towards a line of trees. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . 'The canopy of all the trees shook - I would use the word 'imploded' - and there was luggage, bits of car, and parts of tree flying into the air,' Mr Donald said. Under questioning from defence QC Christopher Millington, Mr Donald agreed that time-lapse CCTV footage of the L200 showed a 'rather less dramatic' veer than he had described to the court. Witness Steven Prince, a passenger in a Range Rover which stopped at the scene, told how he attempted to reassure Mrs Walters before she was cut free. Giving his recollection on the aftermath of the crash, Mr Prince told the jury panel he did not witness the moment of impact but had seen a cloud of dust. 'I looked left and I saw two dogs out where they shouldn't be and I saw the car that was already in the tree.' After the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews, the court was told . The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash . Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse . After getting out of his mother's car, Mr Prince said, he ran along the hard shoulder towards the crashed vehicle. 'The car was a hell of a mess,' Mr Prince added. 'I didn't bother looking at the driver's side because I thought whoever was in there was going to be squashed.' The court heard that the witness then made his way to the passenger side of the vehicle, where he saw a hand sticking out of the wreckage. He said: 'She said she was dying. I told her she would be alright and that I wasn't going anywhere, just to calm her down and make her feel at ease as much as I could.' Prosecutor Charles Miskin QC asked Mr Prince if Mrs Walters, who was aged 48, had said anything else. 'No, other than that she couldn't breathe,' Mr Prince replied. 'She kept on telling me that and she kept on saying that she was dying.' The trial, which may last for up to a month, was adjourned until next week.

It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. ‘Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane.

    "input": "(CNN)When Al-Shabaab gunmen slaughtered 147 people at a college campus in Garissa, Kenya, on Thursday, it was the bloodiest blow Islamist extremists have dealt to the country since the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. But it was also yet another pave stone in the long path of violence between Kenya and the Somali militants. To understand Thursday's attack, one must understand this: Kenya and Al-Shabaab are at war. Although al Qaeda was behind the 1998 attack that killed more than 200 people, Al-Shabaab has killed many more Kenyans and is by far the country's most persistent tormenter, according to a University of Maryland study. Their attacks have notched up since 2008. And in October 2011, Kenya Defense Forces invaded Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based, with the crushing Operation Linda Nchi, Swahili for \"Protect the Country.\" Thus began a bloody vicious cycle, with Al-Shabaab retaliating on Kenyan soil with ever more spectacular mass killings. Here are some of the most heinous attacks on Kenya by the Somali terrorist group. Early Thursday, while many students still slept, at least four gunman burst into a Christian prayer service at Garissa University College, leading into Easter Weekend. They shot students and took hostages, whom they herded across campus. As they encountered students, they separated them into Muslims and Christians. They spared the former, eyewitness Joel Ayora said. They killed the latter. Kenyan special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from Somalia's southern border. They killed four gunman, but not before 147 victims were shot dead. In December, Al-Shabaab militants carried out the same macabre division of captives by religion at a rock quarry not far from the Somali border. They shot Christian workers dead, and spared their Muslim colleagues. Red Cross Workers counted at least 36 bodies dumped into the quarry. It was eye-for-an-eye retaliation, the militants said, for raids Kenyan security forces carried out on mosques intended to weed out extremists. Parallel to Operation Linda Nchi, Kenya has gone after ethnic Somalis within their own borders triggering protest by Human Rights Watch, which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment. In a 2011 case, Kenyan authorities reportedly rounded up ethnic Somalis in Garissa and let them sit in the mud, while beating some of them, HRW alleged. Passengers on a bus in Kenya's north were told to recite from the Quran or die in November 2014. Shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed Mandera, near Somalia's border, Al-Shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in. Those who failed to recite verses were gunned down, leaving 28 dead. In its claim of responsibility, Al-Shabaab said the dead were Christians, and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by Kenyans. A day after the attack, Kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into Somalia. They claimed to kill 100 Al-Shabaab militants. In July, Al-Shabaab gunmen opened fire on the Lamu coast, a popular tourist region, and at a police station in a neighboring county.  They killed 22 people. Last May, tour companies evacuated vacationers from Kenya after the UK and United States issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks. Before the Garissa massacre, the Westgate Mall attack was the deepest wound Al-Shabaab had inflicted on Kenya. For four days, four attackers turned the luxury shopping mall in the capital Nairobi into a cauldron of blood, smoke and rubble. Part of the mall collapsed as Kenyan security forces fought for control. At least 61 civilians were killed, as well as a handful of security officers. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya participation in Africa Union military operations in Somalia. Even with Al-Shabaab's shooting in Garissa, al Qaeda's bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest Islamist terror attack on Kenyan soil. In short succession, bombs detonated at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania back then. The Nairobi bombing was much deadlier that the explosion at Dar es Salaam. Al Qaeda founding member Mamdouh Mahmud Salim was arrested and accused in the bombing and is being held in a New York jail, where he still awaits trial. He is serving a 32 year sentence after being convicted of stabbing a prison guard there in the eye.",
    "output": "To understand Thursday's attack, one must understand that Kenya and Al-Shabaab are at war .\nAl Qaeda's 1998 attack on the U.S. Embassy is the single largest, but Al-Shabaab have killed many more Kenyans ."

Jack Mascitelli, from Victoria, ran through Byron Bay naked during schoolies week for a free kebab . Mr Mascitelli, who is studying law and commerce at university, was fined $500 for offensive behaviour. Appearing in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Monday to argue against the fine, Deputy Chief Magistrate Chris O'Brien told Mr Mascitelli: 'What a goose. That's what you are.' 'This is 8.45 in the morning and you are running through the streets with no clothes on. I don't know why you would want a kebab at that time of day,' he added. Mr O'Brien pointed out how children could have seen Mr Mascitelli expose himself and called his actions 'embarrassing'. 'If people had been there with their children, or in my case my grandchildren, to see you exposing yourself ... they're wandering off to have a swim and there you are in all your glory,' Mr O'Brien said. Despite the dressing down inside the courtroom, Mr O'Brien did not record a conviction and said Mr Mascitelli was apologetic. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Mascitelli for comment.

    "input": "The Queen is the most powerful piece in chess. But one of the UK’s most well-known grandmasters has angered women by saying they aren’t smart enough to play the game. Nigel Short, 49, said women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking. The chess commentator and writer said women should accept they were ‘hard-wired very differently’ and weren’t as adept at playing chess as men. Mr Short, who was the first English player to play a World Chess Championship match, made the comments when explaining why there were so few women in competitive chess. Nigel Short has controversially claimed women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking . But critics immediately pointed out that he lost a high-profile game against a woman grandmaster. He told New in Chess magazine: ‘Why should [men and women] function in the same way? ‘I don’t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife [Rea] possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than I do. 'Likewise, she doesn’t feel embarrassed in asking me to manoeuvre the car out of our narrow garage. ‘One is not better than the other, we just have different skills. It would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess, and at a higher level, but rather than fretting about inequality, perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact.’ His comments mirror those of his rival Garry Kasparov, who infamously said: ‘Women, by their nature, are not exceptional chess players: they are not great fighters.’ Female chess players reacted angrily to Mr Short’s statements last night. Hungarian Judit Polgar, above, the former women’s world champion, beat Nigel Short eight classical games to three in total . Amanda Ross, the leader of the Casual Chess club in London, told The Daily Telegraph the comments were ‘incredibly damaging when someone so respected basically endorses sexism’. She added: ‘Judit Polgar, the former women’s world champion, beat Nigel Short eight classical games to three in total, with five draws. ‘She must have brought her man brain. ‘Let’s just hope Nigel didn’t crash his car on those days, trying to park it. 'At least this resolves the age-old debate as to whether there’s a direct link between chess-playing ability and intelligence. Clearly not.’ Mr Short responded to Miss Ross’s comments on Twitter, writing: You seem to suffer from incomprehension. ‘Men and women do have different brains. This is a biological fact. ‘Furthermore, I never said women have inferior brains. That is your crude and false attempt to caricature me.’ Less than two per cent of grandmasters are female, but Hungarian Miss Polgar broke into the upper echelons of the game when she became one of the youngest grandmasters of all time at the age of 15.",

Prosecutors previously said that Robert Dellinger, 54, told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across a median at more than 100mph and plowed into an oncoming SUV. The crash killed 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was eight months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Speaking out: Former Fortune 500 executive Robert Dellinger, 54, said in court during his sentencing Wednesday that he was not suicidal on the day he crashed into a couple's SUV, killing them instantly . Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . During the first day of what is expected to be a two-day sentencing, the former executive at PPG Industries Inc told the court he has 'never been suicidal.,' according to Valley News. Deborah Dellinger, the defendant's wife, described her husband from the witness stand Wednesday as a 'man of ethics, integrity and friendship' who has lived his life with 'grace and modesty,' despite being plagued with serious health problems. Addressing the victims' families sitting in the courtroom, Mrs Dellinger said: 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones. We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013 . Dellinger pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide in the deaths of the young couple and to one count of assault for the fetus' death. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes Thursday. The defendant also faces a wrongful death lawsuit filed in February by the estate of Amanda Murphy. Robert Dellinger's attorneys claimed that the former high-powered executive was suffering from Ambien withdrawal, the effects of a psychiatric drug overdose and Prozac, and the advanced symptoms of multiple sclerosis . Dellinger, who held high-level posts at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., told investigators he was trying to kill himself on December 7, 2013, when he steered his pickup across a highway median in Lebanon, New Hampshire. His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash. The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly. Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter, which were later upgraded to negligent homicide. Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash . According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.'

Britons apparently spend £815million a year to ‘social media proof’ their wardrobe, with men forking out more than women, according to a new study. The research into the rise of the 'insta-wardrobe', which polled 2,000 adults, revealed  nearly one third buy new clothes just to avoid being multi-tagged in the same outfit. Brits spend £815m a year to 'social media proof' their wardrobe, according to a new survey . Almost a fifth said that they would refuse to wear an outfit again if they knew there was a chance of appearing wearing the same thing online, the study showed. And, in a surprising result, men appeared to be the most social-conscious gender, spending an average of £61 to safe-guard against this modern day anxiety, as opposed to women’s £53.50. As social media has made fashion and style more accessible than ever, it drives how we shop and what we wear. Facebook recorded 1.39 billion users at the end of 2014, with Instagram growing to over 300 million users with over 70 million photos and videos being shared every day. Almost a fifth of those polled said that they would refuse to wear an outfit again if they knew there was a chance of appearing in the same outfit online (stock image) Fashion industry commentator Lily Melrose says she is constantly inspired to try new styles by other bloggers on social media . The average adult has 338 Facebook friends, meaning their style selfies are being reviewed and commented on by hundreds of people with each upload. Indeed, one in four of those surveyed by TK Maxx said that gaining comments and likes on their outfits on social media inspires them to try new styles. And sources of style inspiration are also changing; 11 per cent of those polled credited bloggers as more inspirational than fashion designers, with fashion news often breaking exclusively via Facebook and Twitter. Bloggers are now gracing the cover of Vogue and fashion designers are live streaming their shows. Lily Melrose, fashion blogger and industry commentator, commented: 'Instagrammers and bloggers are undoubtedly the new tastemakers of obtainable and relatable style. 'Social media has totally changed the face of fashion today and the way we shop. 'The beauty of social sharing sites is that you can be inspired by such a wide range of people, from your friends, bloggers, celebrities and family. 'On social media there is something for everyone as unique and individual looks are celebrated and shared. 'I can’t count the times I’ve been inspired by another blogger or someone on my Instagram page to try something new and I love sharing my looks with my readers.' Deborah Dolce, Group Brand & Marketing Director at TK Maxx said: 'Social media is moving people toward a wide range of fashion ideals and style icons. 'While celebrity culture is still strong, we now look to a much broader base of people for inspiration from our friends to bloggers to online style trailblazers. Social media platforms enable us to express ourselves freely and showcase our personal style.'",

    "input": "The family of a heavily pregnant Jehovah's Witness who died along with her baby after she refused a blood transfusion, have defended the woman who they said had put her baby's life above her own. Jenny-Lee, 28, was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy, and although doctors at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy, she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion. However her mother Heather has told The Daily Telegraph that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child, named Aroura. 'She knew chemo would kill Aroura — she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened, she wanted that baby alive,' Heather said. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . 'We were told she would have six weeks to live — she fought to have the baby. That's the decision she made — she gave up her life.' Instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter's unnecessary death, claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner, but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy. The Sydney mother's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. Jenny-Lee's elder daughter Chelsie, who was only 10 when her mother died in August 2009, also defended her mother. However the 28-year-old's brother David blamed the religion for how his sister died, calling her a 'fool'. 'It was not my sister who was sad and selfish, it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense,' he said. Jenny-Lee, 28, had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' She was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a challenge to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. In a recent article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber Biscoe wrote: 'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.

Its Chief Executive Rob Williams told MailOnline: 'One of these children told me that she and her mother had spend two hours picking up the body parts of her little sister who had been hit by shell fire as she played outside. 'This kind of experience can stay with a child and become a dominant part of their consciousness, blocking concentration and coming out as mental flashbacks so intense they induce total terror.' Mr Williams claims their counselling programme helps children regain 'emotional control' but he says for every child they help, 'there are at least 50 others' who need it. A massive number of Syrians have sought refuge in Jordan this month, according to a recent UNHCR report. Around 250 Syrian refugees cross the border every day and in just four days leading up to March 18, over one thousand people had escaped the embattled country for Jordan. The refugees are coming from the embattled northern city of Aleppo and also from the city of Dara'a which borders Jordan in the south of Syria. Grief: Conflict charity War Child says thousands of children carry 'deep trauma from what they have been through inside Syria . Exodus: Around 250 Syrian refugees cross the border every day and in just four days leading up to March 18, over one thousand people escaped the embattled country for Jordan . Arrivals at the Azraq refugee camp said they preferred to stay in the volatile and dangerous city for four years because they did not want to become refugees. But an increasing number of armed attacks, daily shelling and aerial bombardment forced them to flee their homes. One of the camps inhabitants says the situation in Dara'a became too dangerous in November when 'armed groups from all sides' came to the besieged city. 44-year-old Ismael said: 'We kept saying we would give it one more month, but now most of the people in our village have either fled or been killed, so we left.' Despite reaching safety, he remains traumatised by months of insecurity and the agonising decision of leaving behind his 65-year-old mother who can not walk. 'Back in Syria it was so unsafe. We didn't really sleep at night, we just lay in bed with our eyes open. 'So when we got to Jordan, I felt a bit relieved to be safe, but I'm still so worried about my family back home and I have no way to contact them.'",

    "input": "Arrested: Ashley Doody was arrested on Sunday after allegedly attacking the family dog with a kitchen knife . A 30-year-old mother-of-two allegedly high on bath salts stabbed her family dog with a kitchen knife because she thought it was possessed by demons, according to police in Maine. Aroostook County Sheriff's Office responded to a home in Perham on Sunday and found Ashley Doody acting aggressively and exhibiting unpredictable behavior. They discovered that Doody, who is a nurse, had attacked her mixed-breed dog, Trixie. The sheriff says the dog lost a lot of blood but was taken to a veterinarian and is expected to survive - while Doody is in jail on $1,000 bail. She has been charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and is due to appear before Aroostock County Superior Court on May 19. According to deputies, when they arrived at the home, Doody was threatening to harm herself with the knife. They discovered that she had stabbed Trixie believing the dog was 'demon possessed.' Police have said that they believe Doody had taken bath salts which can cause severe agitation, paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal behavior in users. State animal welfare agents have been notified of the attack and already Doody has been banned from any access to pets in the future. According to her Facebook page, Doody is engaged to be married to Mark Sawyer and has been since May 2008. Seriously injured: Trixie (pictured) is a mixed-breed family dog and was knifed by Doody while she was allegedly high on bath salts on Sunday . Cruelty: According to deputies who arrested Doody she will not be allowed to own a pet after her actions . She claims to work as a nurse at Full Circle Health Care LLC and is a mother to two children. Since the beginning of the month, Doody has been posting self-help and life-affirming messages to her Facebook page such as 'Until you've lived my life, walked my path, suffered my pain and seen what I've seen, I could care less about your judgements.'",

    "input": "Outed on Grindr: Republican lawmaker from North Dakota, Randy Boehning, has an over 10-year history of voting against gay rights. On Monday, he was outed for using gay hook-up app Grindr . A Republican lawmaker in North Dakota with a long record of opposition to pro-gay rights laws was revealed this week to be an active user of gay hook-up app Grindr and claims he was outed as part of a smear campaign by a rival. Randy Boehning, a 52-year-old who's represented Fargo since 2002, sent messages and a photo of his penis to a 21-year-old gay man in Bismark named Dustin Smith. Smith recognized the staunch conservative and took his story, and explicit photo, to the press. But, while admitting he's gay and uses Grindr, the public official claimed his private life was revealed as part of a fellow lawmaker's retaliation for his vote against a bill that would afford protections to gays. Smith told Forum on Monday that he first recognized Boehning, who he knew by the Grindr handle Top Man!, while reading an April 2 article that pictured all the state's House of Representatives members who voted down an anti-discrimination bill. 'Suddenly it dawned on me: I think I've seen this guy on Grindr!' Smith told the Washington Post on Wednesday. Using the 'an all-male location-based social network' on his phone, Smith retrieved the conversation in question in which Boehning, without solicitation, sent a photo of his penis along with one of his face. 'I just felt like this story had to get out,' Smith said. '[He] voted against a bill for the LGBT community and here he was talking to me on Grindr.' Forum ran their story on Monday, in which Boehning both came out and accused an employee at his workplace for exposing him after he exposed himself. 'That's what gay guys do on gay sites, don't they?' Boehning told Forum. 'That's how things happen on Grindr. It's a gay chat site. It's not the first thing you do on that site. That's what we do, exchange pics on the site.' Top Man! Dustin Smith, a 21-year-old gay man who lives in Bismarck, recognized Boehning as Grindr user Top Man! and took his story to the local press . Boehning went on to claim that, prior to his April 2 vote against the anti-discrimination bill, a capitol employee warned him that a fellow lawmaker who supported the bill vowed Boehning would become a target for retaliation should he vote no. However, Boehning has thus far refused to name that lawmaker. Meanwhile, the only openly gay lawmaker in the state's legislature, Rep. Josh Boschee of Fargo, said he never spoke to Boehning about the vote. Boschee claims he's been told of a Republican staffer who's been in contact with Boehning via Grindr since he was last elected and who warned Boehning 'there could be consequences for the hypocrisy of [his] vote.' Boschee also declined to name any names. As for his coming out, Boehning, who says he's also attracted to women, seemed somewhat relieved. 'The 1,000-pound gorilla has been lifted,' he said. 'I have to confront it at some point.' Blackmailed? Boehning claims he was blackmailed by a Capitol employee just before his most recent vote against a gay rights bill. Weeks later, he was outed .",

    "input": "Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the fourth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time. RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE . George Foreman v Muhammad Ali . Kinshasa, Zaire . October 30, 1974 . The fight voted the greatest sporting event of the 20th century. The fight which crossed oceans and continents. The fight which drove boxing through social barriers. The fight which put a shadowy central African republic on the world map. The fight which established Muhammad Ali as the most recognisable human being on Earth. The fight which made George Foreman famous in defeat. The fight about which millions of words have been written and movies made. A photograph taken on October 30, 1974, shows Muhammad Ali (left) and George Foreman (right) USA's  Foreman (right) approaches his compatriot Ali (left)  during the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 . The Rumble in the Jungle was the brainchild of promotional genius Don King backed by the multi-million dollar investment through which Zaire president Mobuto Sese Seko hoped to excite his people into keeping him in power. King had persuaded Ali and Foreman to sign $5million contracts which he could not afford but would talk President Mobuto into bank-rolling. JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . As the 25-year-old world heavyweight champion with enormous punching power Foreman was odds-on favourite to crush the brilliance of the man they called The Greatest but who, at 32 and diminished by his three-and-a-half-year banishment from the ring for refusing to go to war in Vietnam, was perceived as a fading force. Ali went to work on Foreman’s psyche from the moment the circus arrived in Kinshasa, turning up at his training session to mock Big George for his size and make fun of his intellect. The irritating effect on Foreman was prolonged after he suffered an eye-cut in sparring, the date of the fight was put back more than a month and King, fearful of cancellation, insisted they stayed in Zaire instead of taking a break back in America. Ali also charmed the local population, who happily took to the streets throughout those weeks chanting ‘Ali, boma-ye’ – ‘Ali, kill him.’ The fight developed into a tactical triumph for Ali, albeit a self-punishing one which may have contributed to the subsequent onset of Parkinson’s which afflicts him now. Ali (left) often found himself against the ropes in a strategy which even surprised his trainer Angelo Dundee . Ali spent much of his time against the ropes, inviting Foreman to punch himself out before landing his blow . In a strategy which he later entitled ‘Rope-A-Dope’ – and which came as a surprise to everyone including his fabled trainer Angelo Dundee - Ali spent much of his time lolling against the ropes, inviting Foreman to punch himself out. Big George duly obliged by throwing hundreds of blows in the first seven rounds. Ali evaded many of those punches and blocked numerous with his arms but he had to withstand the brute force of those which got through his defences. The verbal taunting went on. ‘They told me you could punch, George,’ he said as Foreman began to flag. ‘Is that all you got, George?’ he rasped as Foreman connected to the Ali chin with virtually the last of the punches which had knocked out many a former foe. It had not been all negative. Throughout, Ali had peppered the swelling Foreman face with break-out with lightning combinations and the steamy 4 am heat had contributed to the weakening process. Foreman, the world heavyweight champion, is down on count two after being struck by Ali's right-hander . Ali looks on after he knocked Foreman to the canvas with the holy mother of all right-handers during the bout . Come the eighth round, come the coup de grace. A succession of right hooks, a two-fisted burst and then a left-hook which straightened up Big George to receive the holy mother of all right-handers. Foreman staggered to his feet at the count of nine but referee Zack Clayton knew he was finished. Sensation. Bedlam in the jungle. Astonishment around the satellite world. Foreman would eventually emerge from denial to become Ali’s great friend, an inspiring Christian preacher and the seller of countless top-of-the-range barbecues. Ali was still The Greatest. Ali's staff and the referee put their arms around Ali after he settled the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 .",

A 14-year-old boy was taken into custody after encouraging an attack on an Australian parade honoring the war dead and urging the beheading of \"someone in Australia,\" Deborah Walsh, deputy head of counter terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement Thursday. The teenager was taken into custody April 2 after UK's Greater Manchester police examined electronic devices and discovered communications between the teen and a man in Australia, police said in a statement. The teenager, arrested in Blackburn, Lancashire, was not named \"because of legal reasons,\" the statement said. He was charged with two counts of inciting another person to commit an act of terrorism overseas and will appear in Westminster Magistrate's Court on Friday.

    "input": "Jose Mourinho had placed the Barclays Premier League’s joint-top goalscorer on standby for this match, insisting he would only turn to Diego Costa if absolutely necessary. As it turned out, the emergency glass needed to be broken. The £32million striker was required to stop Chelsea squandering the opportunity to open a seven-point advantage over their title rivals. Yet all they got was 11 minutes before Costa was forced off with a recurrence of the hamstring injury that ruled him out of the international break with Spain. Chelsea striker Diego Costa limped off with a hamstring injury shortly after coming on at the interval . Will he be out for a week, a month, two months, maybe more? ‘It’s too early,’ said Mourinho, who went on to defend throwing Costa on. ‘I don’t say “gamble” because we did every test, every scan, the player trained for two days, he was 100 per cent with the team. ‘The medical department were convinced he was ready. The player was convinced he was ready. Not for 90 minutes but he was ready to play and to help the team.’ In the meantime a chunk of the Chelsea contingent will be wondering how they fill the void left by Costa. They need look no further than this win against Stoke as the answer presents itself in the form of Loic Remy and, of course, Eden Hazard. Blues striker Costa looks despondent as he sits on the turf following another injury to his hamstring . Hazard scored and assisted in the same Premier League match for the seventh time, and looked like a man ready to rubbish the idea he was too tired to play a full 90 minutes for Belgium in midweek. He tormented the Stoke defence here at Stamford Bridge, and has scored more Premier League goals for Chelsea over the past three seasons than any other player. That’s 35, by the way. So, too, was Remy equally as clinical against Stoke. Acting as Costa’s replacement for the starting XI, he proved more than a handful for the visitors on his fourth start for Chelsea in the Premier League. It took an outstanding one-handed save from Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic at full stretch to deny Remy’s deflected shot from giving Chelsea the lead after just three minutes. Then, four minutes later, it was him again, going close as his curled shot skipped agonisingly wide of the far post. The man turned down by Liverpool was given the unfortunate task of trying to fill the boots of Costa, but rarely looked shy in doing so. Yet it remained 0-0 as half time approached. Was it time for Mourinho to roll the dice? It was in the 32nd minute his patience wore thin. Costa looks in pain after pulling up at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City . Chelsea gave away possession in the final third – not for the first time – and a frowning Mourinho turned to his substitutes’ bench, gestured at Costa with a nod, and the striker began warming up down the touchline. A sign he was to be introduced soon enough. It took a smidgen of luck for the deadlock to be broken thanks to the quick feet of Cesc Fabregas earning a penalty, and Hazard was cool as ever in putting Chelsea ahead. Never in doubt, as no player in Premier League history has taken more and never missed than Hazard. Yet Stamford Bridge’s celebrations were short-lived. Mourinho’s frustration grew when Charlie Adam channelled his inner David Beckham and scored from more than 60 yards out. With Thibaut Courtois left embarrassed, Mourinho knew it was time to ‘gamble’. Jose Mourinho was happy to have gambled with Costa's fitness despite losing the striker after 10 minutes . Off went Oscar, on came Costa for the second half. No sooner had he been on the pitch than he had to come off. He signalled to the bench after just 10 minutes and was replaced by veteran Didier Drogba. Yet this was all about Chelsea's go-to guy, Hazard, and Costa’s worthy replacement, Remy. ‘We have three strikers,’ Mourinho declared afterwards. ‘We decided at the beginning of the season to go more with Diego. He won the right of being first choice.’ But by this evidence, Chelsea supporters need not lose sleep over their first-choice striker's injury. As Stoke found out, Remy can fill the gap left by Costa, and Hazard is simply every bit a Premier League title winner in the making. Eden Hazard steps up to stroke home the opener for Chelsea from the penalty spot in the first half . Remy finishes to put Chelsea back in front after a mistake from Stoke City keeper Begovic .",
    "output": "Chelsea will be without top scorer Diego Costa for at least two games .\nThe £32m striker suffered recurrence of hamstring injury against Stoke .\nLoic Remy and Eden Hazard scored in 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge ."

    "input": "As Zlatan Ibrahimovic famously believes the World Cup is 'nothing to watch' without him, he's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing Lionel Messi in the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. For most people, Barcelona's progress into the Champions League semi-final looks a formality given they beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the first leg in France. The only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography 'I am Zlatan'. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is put through his paces with Blaise Matuidi (left) and Zoumana Camara at the Nou Camp . Ibrahimovic and his PSG team-mates, including David Luiz, pictured, face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33, Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet, he'll walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team-mates he'd played with, he named himself up front with Messi – ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. 'Football isn't something you plan in advance. It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him £200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to £50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance – except for Zlatan himself.",

Patients at Wolfson Children's Hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them. Scroll down for video . The toys include a long 'tail' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. The Idaho firm behind the system has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the US, letting anyone play with cats via the system - and plans to sell a version for pet owners via Kickstarter next month. 'Play through programs like the Play with Cats project has a powerful normalizing effect on a child's hospital stay,' said Wolfson Children's Hospital President Michael Aubin. Patients who are in isolation with a specific treatment or a chronic medical condition like cystic fibrosis or bone marrow transplant will be among the first to benefit. Made possible with a $15,000 grant from the Mattel Children's Foundation, the Play with Cats program connects to 151 hospital rooms throughout Wolfson Children's Hospital via GetWellNetwork. The Wolfson Children's Hospital Auxiliary first started a Pet Therapy Program in 1995. Two years ago, the hospital opened a pet visitation program, allowing children with long-term stays or in end-of-life situations to receive a visit from their own dog. 'This is the latest program to be implemented at Wolfson Children's Hospital to give more of our patients a chance to interact with a kitten or cat, which provides a welcome distraction.' said Pat Kirkland, Family Support Services Manager at Wolfson Children's Hospital. 'About 20 percent of our patients are on isolation at some time during their stay, so we are excited to bring the healing power of an animal friend to the bedside.' 'Our partnership with Wolfson Children's Hospital began with JHS veterinarians providing required vet checks and vaccines that allow patients in the hospital to visit with their own dogs. 'We are proud to expand the partnership using iPet so that all patients may benefit from the healing power of animals,' said Denise Deisler, executive director of the Jacksonville Humane Society. The system was developed by Idaho firm ReachIn. 'The idea came from the ability to move anything over the web,' Scott Harris of the firm told MailOnline. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. 'We started working on the technical side of remote control, and then an engineer went home to work on arm overnight. The next day he came in, took me to one side and said he'd been moving the arm, and his cat had started playing with it. He admitted he then hadn't got any work done and spent the evening watching the cat play - so I thought we might be on to something.' The firm contacted a local animals shelter and worked with them to build three toys. In May 2012, the first catcam went online, and was a huge success. Users join a virtual queue, and can then control three toys and a webcam in the enclosure. The iCompanion site that visitors play with cats in rescue homes around the US virtually . Now the firm plans to expand the idea after huge interest from shelters. Users from 90 countries played within 2 weeks playing, and adoption rates went up 57% at shelters, said Harris. The firm is now trying to work out how to fund the systems after over 300 charities got in touch wanting it. The firm is launching a kickstarter campaign to allow people to buy their own version of the system on May 1st. Users can control a variety of toys in the enclosures . 'it costs us to build these things and maintain them, and 317 shelters have requested it, so we are working with as many as we can.'

Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. \"At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint,\" Jamie Davis said.  \"That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us.\" As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. \"At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known,\" said Troi Ge.  \"He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'\" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" Collins said. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Flight cancellations soared by 20 per cent and delays by 7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. UK passengers faced more holiday chaos than during the same period last year, according to analysis from flight data specialist EUclaim. In the first four months of the year, there have so far been 5,080 flight cancellations, compared to the 4,239 cancellations during the same period in 2014. According to flight data specialist EUclaim, cancellations and delays are on the rise so far this year over last . The number of delays also increased to 2,427 from 2,260 in 2014. It's low-cost carrier Monarch that has seen the greatest increase in delays so far, with passengers suffering 64 incidents compared to 47 during the same period of time last year. That's an increase of 30 per cent. And EasyJet hasn't fared much better, experiencing a 19 per cent increase in delays. During last year's first quarter, there were a reported 206 hold-ups, while this year has already seen 245. However, airlines are refuting the figures. A spokesperson fro Monarch said: 'The recent media report in regards to the on time performance during the first quarter of this year is incorrect and misleading. 'For clarity, during the first quarter of 2015 we experienced winter weather across Europe which has been far worse than the same period last year, which particularly affected our operation to and from France, as well as the recent the French ATC strike which affected many carriers across Europe. It should be noted that during this time frame Monarch Airlines’ did not cancel any flights. 'In the event of strikes or weather disruption, the business model of many other airline carriers is to cancel services; which will protect their on-time performance, but of course have a negative impact on their customers. 'Monarch Airlines will only cancel flights if there is absolutely no viable way of operating that flight thus placing the highest value on getting customers to their destination as opposed to protecting our on-time performance by tactically cancelling our flights.' Low-cost carrier Monarch has fared the worst so far in 2015, experiencing a 30% increase in delays . Despite all the hold ups, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced its delays by 37% . But it may not be entirely the fault of the airlines. Monarch - 39% increase . EasyJet - 19% increase . Jet2 - 17% increase . Virgin - 7% increase . Thomson - 6% increase . Ryanair - 6% increase . British Airways - 11% decrease . Thomas Cook - 37% decrease . Winter weather across Europe this year has been far worse than the same period last year and has particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch's routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. Similarly, delays and cancellations could also be attributed to a number of strikes on the continent. The four-day Lufthansa strike in March resulted in some 116 cancellations of flights to the UK. Strikes by Italian Air Traffic Controllers and security staff in Germany also compounded such a problem. Still, despite the external factors, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced delays by 37 per cent, and British Airways also saw an 11 per cent reduction in stoppages. Monarch Airlines contests the EUclaim figures, however, telling MailOnline Travel that 'their source of information is questionable. 'They claim that their data comes directly from the aircrafts on board ACARS and ADS-B systems, but Monarch Airlines use neither of these. 'The reason that our OTP figures appear higher than other airlines is due to the fact that we have not cancelled any flights. 'We put our customers before our OTP and would rather operate with a delay than not at all.'",
    "output": "In the first four months of the year, flight cancellations are up 20% over last .\nNumber of delays have also increased 7% up to 2,427 so far this year .\nAccording to EUclaim, the worst offenders include: Monarch and EasyJet ."

    "input": "After two months since the official announcement, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are into the final few days of their preparation at camp ahead of their monumental bout on Saturday. On Monday night, Pacquiao arrived in Las Vegas ahead of his MGM Grand summit with Mayweather. The 36-year-old was seen arriving on the world-famous Strip in the Nevada desert at the Mandalay Bay hotel, which will be his base for the week. Pacquiao had been training in Los Angeles at trainer Freddie Roach's Wild Card Gym - an unassuming building that is surrounded by a launderette and a petrol station. The Filipino star uprooted on Monday night as he and his team took a 270-mile drive on board his own bus. Roach's star fighter will be hoping a change of scenery won't affect his preparations against Mayweather - who has the luxury of training at his self-titled Boxing Club in Las Vegas, which is situated next to a Chinese Baptist Church. Ahead of their gigantic fight, Sportsmail takes a tale of the tape look at the duo's two main bases and what is on offer at either facility. Manny Pacquiao gestures to fans gathered after arriving at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas on Monday .

Despite the wealth of talent that trains at the Wild Card Gym and the Mayweather Boxing Club, both are in rather low-key surroundings. The former is situated along Vine Street - an unassuming road in Los Angeles which is set back from its nearby properties. Next to it on the right is a Stop & Shop Market while a Mobil petrol station is situatied to its left. In among the small complex too is a nail parlour, a Thai food restaurant and a launderette. The latter is on Schiff Drive - another unassuming road. Next to the building on one side is a Chinese Baptist Church, with KitcheNova - a kitchen supllies shop a futher store down. It's fair to say that both gyms could be lost among a backdrop of similar-looking buildings. The Wild Card Gym is located on the unassuming road of Vine Street in Los Angeles . On closer viewing the facility is also surrounded by a a nail parlour, a Thai food restaurant and a launderette . An inside look of the Wild Card Gym shows it has one boxing ring and several boxing pads . A front view look of the WBA and WBC welterweight world champion Mayweather base . The Mayweather Boxing Club is also an inconspicuous building from the outside on Schiff Drive, Las Vegas . Inside though, the The Money Team's facilities are anything but with the state-of-art equipment adorning it . The Las Vegas base has a free weights section where Mayweather uses to develop his strength . The Mayweather Boxing Club has seats provided for those to watch sparring and other boxing activities . Mayweather has put his vast wealth into the facility - a building that has helped him remain undefeated . Both boxers will be hoping their facilities will have proved the base for success come May 2 . OPENING HOURS . Despite being the home of eight-division world champion Pacquiao, the Wild Card gym is an accessible facility to those of any age or ability. Between Monday to Friday it is open from 7am-8pm with its hours on a Saturday slightly reduced from 9am-4pm. The Wild Card gym is closed on Sundays. The Wild Card gym is an accessible facility to those of any age or ability and is open six days a week . In stark comparison, the Mayweather Boxing Club is a private facility that is not open to the general public.

Monthly prices for those who don't box at amateur level or professionally and are 18 or over is at around £33 per month. For those between the ages of 11-17, the price reduces further to £16 per month but they must be accompanied by a parent at all times. The Wild Card gym is open to anyone of any ability with monthly membership starting at £16 per month .

If a monthly membership proves too daunting, Roach's gym also offers daily entry of around £3 as long as you have proof of ID. The openness of the Wild Card gym conflicts with that of Mayweather's camp - where you have to contact their official website if you have a desire to train at the club. In contrast to use the Mayweather Boxing Club - you have to contact their website for more information first . EQUIPMENT . The Wild Card gym is rather simplistic in comparison to the Mayweather Boxing Club - but still produces the same knockout results. In terms of equipment there is one ring, a weights room as well as the standard boxing bags you would expect to create a world champion - speed balls, punch bags, boxing pads and the rest of that ilk. Pacquaio is put through his paces on the speed ball during a workout session at the Wild Card Gym in 2010 . Pacquaio (right) undergoes some pad work while training at the the Los Angeles base .

As well as owning the facility, the 55-year-old works alongside it with his brother Pepper. Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach (right) has produced over 20 world champions during his time . The Mayweather Boxing Club is a family affair with the 38-year-old's father, Floyd Snr, training him there. Alongside his father, Mayweather's uncle Roger is a key figure within the camp. The 54-year-old proves valuable boxing acumen to the stable having been a former WBA Super featherweight and WBC light-welterweight champion himself with a record of 59 – 13 (35 KO’s). Alongside the duo, Cornelius Edwards is another experienced trainer with the camp. Known as 'Boza' the former WBC Super Featherweight Champion boasted a record of 45-7-1 with 34 KO’s during his time within the ring.

Mayweather's 'The Money Team' camp includes his father, Floyd Snr, and his uncle Roger . NOTABLE STABLE MATES . The Wild Card Gym has boasted an array of stars in the world of boxing, with Miguel Cotto the latest under the tutelage of Roach. The 34-year-old is the current WBC middleweight world champion after he defeated Sergio Martinez for the title last summer in his first fight in the division. Cotto is considered one of the greatest boxers in Puerto Rican history and is the only countryman to have won a world title in four different weight classes. As well as Cotto former WBO light-welterweight champion Ruslan Provodnikov and Chinese star Zou Shiming are also trained by Roach.

British star Amir Khan, Julio Cesar Chavez, Jr. Viacheslav Senchenko are among those to have been under the Los Angeles stable. Roach has also worked with a number of MMA greats including Anderson Silva, Georges St. Pierre, Tito Ortiz and BJ Penn. Former WBO light-heavyweight world champion Nathan Cleverly has also visited the facility in the past ahead of upcoming bouts. Amir Khan (right) was trained by Roach before splitting up in 2012 after losing two world titles . Mayweather's gym too has been a hotbed for boxers to hone their skills ahead of a fight too - with Britain's crop of talent in particular taking the Las Vegas base to their fancy. Chris Eubank Jnr trained there in his early days, while Scott Quigg and Anthony Crolla have also visited the club to engage in some pad-work activities.

The Prime Minister said the Scottish National Party would prop up a minority Labour administration in the hope that the government would be a 'disaster' and bring forward its dream of independence. But Liberal Democrat Cabinet minster Danny Alexander accused the Prime Minister of 'playing with fire' by stirring up ill-feeling between Scotland and England in a way that would only fuel support for independence in next year's Scottish Parliament elections. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, addressing supporters in Somerset this afternoon, has warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain', as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed' The Prime Minister - taking a selfie with supporters today, said the Scottish National Party would prop up a minority Labour administration in the hope that the government would be a 'disaster' and bring forward its dream of independence . The warnings came as polls indicated that the General Election race was still neck and neck, with the UK heading for a hung parliament and coalition negotiations after May 7. A Survation poll put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent. However, other polls had Labour nudging ahead. Today's Survation poll found that more than a third of English voters would not regard a Miliband administration propped up by the SNP as 'legitimate'. More than two-fifths - 44 per cent - meanwhile said that they would rather see England break away from Scotland than have an arrangement of this kind. Mr Cameron told the Sunday Express that an outright Conservative victory could make Britain 'one of the great international success stories of the next decade'. The Prime Minister echoed Tony Blair's 'education, education, education' slogan when he said his three top priorities would be 'economy, economy, economy'. But he warned: 'There are 11 days left to save the economy, to save jobs, effectively to save Britain.' A Survation poll has put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent . Mr Cameron was interviewed on the Murnaghan programme, broadcast this morning, warning of the threat posed by the SNP . Mr Cameron said that the SNP 'want to achieve the break-up of our country, so therefore if you have a Labour government backed by the SNP, you have got a government backed by people who don't want the country to succeed. 'They don't want parliament to succeed. They don't want the government to succeed. They don't want the United Kingdom to succeed. That is really worrying.' Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond will want voters to look back after five years of a minority Labour adminstration made possible by the SNP and think 'that was a disaster, now can we break up the United Kingdom altogether?', said the Prime Minister. Mr Alexander was highly critical of the Conservatives' decision to focus their election campaign on the threat of Scottish nationalism. Ed Miliband, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, insisted Labour would not do any deals with the SNP . The Labour leader is under growing pressure to rule out governing with the support of SNP MPs . The Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury told The Observer: 'I think the Tory campaign has been a total disgrace. I think they are deliberately trying to stir up ill-feeling between Scotland and England in a desperate attempt to fend off Ukip and I think it has long-term consequences. When you stoke tensions, you are playing with fire.' Mr Alexander added: 'I think a majority Tory government would be a disaster for the whole of the United Kingdom because it would lurch this country to the right economically ... but it would be a particular disaster in Scotland, because it would give the SNP what they most want . - a grievance to nurse for the Scottish parliamentary election in 2016.' And former Liberal leader Lord Steel told the paper: 'The truth is that a new Tory government dependent on Ukip sympathisers in their own midst is a greater threat to the unity of the UK than any band of SNP MPs.'",

But now the age of political correctness appears to have caught up with the Queen’s Norfolk estate. For every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display and replaced with what one visitor called ‘trinkets and bric-a-brac’. Throwback: How the trophy room at Sandringham used to look, complete with stuffed rhino heads . Bric-a-brac: Sandringham's updated display - and even the blood-red walls have been repainted white . All 62 items – including an Indian tiger, a leopard, skins and tusks – have been placed in storage. Even the blood-red walls have been painted white, as if to make clear the break with the past. The drastic change was apparent when the estate reopened its doors to the public on Saturday. Following the winter closure, a new sign outside the Sandringham museum makes pointed reference to how changing times have spelled the end for some exhibits. After explaining that the museum opened in 1928 to house George V’s collection of ‘big game trophies’, the message says: ‘Thankfully, due to the work of organisations like the World Wide Fund for Nature, whose President was HRH Prince Philip until 1996, this destructive era is drawing to a close – the camera having replaced the gun in recording the sightings of these magnificent animals.’ Questions were raised in December about the legality of ‘unworked items’ – those not fundamentally changed from their natural state – dating from prior to 1947. Under a European Council regulation, the uncarved ivory, stuffed lions and white rhinos all potentially broke the law as they were not on show with an official certificate. The Animal and Plant Health Agency – an arm of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – confirmed there was a ‘potential legal question mark’ about some of the contents of the room. Bygone era: The room, which featured stuffed lions, must have been embarrassing for animal welfare crusader Prince William . Chnging times: Now every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display . The situation was particularly embarrassing for Prince William, who had just denounced the illegal wildlife trade in ivory, rhino horn and endangered animal parts during a speech in Washington DC. He had also previously called for the Royal Family’s ivory collection to be destroyed. And the royals now appear to have taken decisive action by removing the items from display – but whether their replacements are particularly interesting is another matter entirely. The new items include an ashtray used by King George V, a Sandringham Cycling Club badge dating from 1895 and an embroidered cover of Radio Times that marked the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. An ornate cabinet of ‘curios’ from a primary school on the estate contains dolls, jewellery made from oyster shells and a dried puffer fish. The only other creatures to be found are stuffed birds in a glass cabinet and a butterfly collection. One visitor who went along to Sandringham on Saturday said: ‘Every last animal head, stuffed animal or skin has gone. Gone: All 62 items – including an Indian tiger, a leopard, skins and tusks – have been placed in storage . ‘There’s a real mixed bag now of bizarre and random things. Someone has come in and taken everything out of there, whitewashed the place and put in an entire room of trinkets and bric-a-brac.’ A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said yesterday that the trophies had been put away to make room for an exhibition of paintings by members of the British, Danish, Greek and Russian royal families. He added: ‘Changes were made to the Sandringham museum during the winter closure as part of an ongoing process of updating and refreshing the displays.’ A source said the legality of around five items had been questioned although those in charge of the collection were ‘still sure’ they had not broken the law.",

Hugh Roche Kelly, who was flying from Berlin to Paris yesterday morning, posted the account on his Twitter profile of how the pilot managed to dispel the 'tense vibe' by his actions. Data from the second black box recorder on Germanwings Flight 4U9525 today confirmed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the Airbus A320 into the side of a mountain into the French Alps, killing 150 people. Scroll down for video . A Germanwings Airbus A320 much like the one which crashed in the French Alps, killing 150 people. A passenger on one of the company's flights from Berlin to Paris has praised the pilot for calming nerves . Hugh Roche Kelly posted on his Twitter account how impressed he was with the pilot's pre-flight speech . Andreas Lubitz, the Germanwings co-pilot who deliberately brought down Flight 4U9525 last week . Nerves were calmed on Mr Kelly's flight as he took the time to say a few words in three different languages, saying he was thankful passengers were still prepared to fly with the company. Mr Kelly's post said: 'There was a tense vibe - the crew were on edge and some passengers were definitely more nervous than normal. 'Once I was actually onboard, and looked at the crew door, it was all too easy to imagine how horrific the time before that crash would have been. 'I was thinking about what kind of a response a company should make to something like this. Do you ask everyone to carry on as normal, with utmost professionalism and a stiff upper lip? 'Then, our pilot came out and made almost his normal pre flight speech, except he did so standing in the front row. 'He spoke about how it was a difficult and strange time for him and for all the cabin crew, how they still all love doing their job, and how they're thankful that they still have passengers coming onto their planes. 'Mostly though, he said he just wanted to come out and stand in front of everyone and let all the passengers on his flight have a moment of eye contact with him, and for us to meet him and for him to meet us.'

Mr Kelly added that the pilot's efforts had made him feel 'enormous respect for him', adding 'anyone listening could tell it was a difficult thing to do - to stand in front of 150 more-nervous-than-they-really-needed-to-be people and say \"everything's going to be fine, because I am going to look after it\". 'So, well done that man.' The aviator's impressive efforts came just days after it emerged how fellow Germanwings pilot Frank Woiton hugged each individual passenger as they boarded a plane preparing to retrace the route taken by ill-fated Flight 4U9525 just two days after it crashed. Woiton, 48, told German newspaper Bild how he received a huge round of applause after he delivered an emotional speech before takeoff on the flight between Barcelona and Dusselforf.

The revelation adds further weight to evidence from the cockpit voice recorder that Lubitz acted deliberately when he crashed the Airbus A320 into the French Alps at 430mph. A judicial source working alongside Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the information confirmed their worst fears. The second black box, which was found charred and crumpled at the crash site yesterday, measures data such as speed, altitude and pilot action and was an 'indispensable element' in the investigation, said the source. The BEA air accident agency said in a statement that investigators have so far only obtained initial readings from the device and were continuing to extract data.

Pacquiao is watched by a group of fans who gather to see their man in action ahead of the super-fight . Bob Arum, Pacquiao's promoter, says: 'Bayless is the best out there.' Bayless, a veteran of countless big fights in Las Vegas, will celebrate his 65th birthday two days after supervising the Fight of the Century in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Nevada State Athletic Commission, acutely aware that the officiating has to be of the highest order, given that the fight is likely to attract an audience well beyond those who usually watch boxing, have wisely put their trust in the large physical presence and unflappable personality of Bayless. Recent controversial results have put the Commission under pressure to bring in officials from outside Nevada for the mega-fights here and have made one concession in that regard. Glenn Feldman, a much respected judge from Connecticut, will be among the three wise men scoring a fight which most expect to go the 12-round distance. The two other judges are Las Vegas resident Dave Moretti and Burt Clements, from Reno. Serious consideration was given to including a judge from overseas and John Keane, a British Boxing Board Class A-star official from Wellingingborough, Northampton was thought to be the favourite. Bayless has refereed previous super fights involving Mayweather and Pacqiao. Recently, he was in charge of Mayweather's difficult physical battle against Marcos Maidana and Pacquiao's spectacular knock-out by Juan Manuel Marquez. He will receive $25,000 (£16,600) for the night's work in May, while the judges will each receive $20,000 (£13,300). It is still peanuts compared with the $180 million and $120 million which are the respective minimums expected to earned by Mayweather and Pacquiao but the officials are being paid somewhat more than expected.

Scroll down for video . Candlestick park, which has been home to the San Francisco Giants and San Francisco 49ers, has been torn down . The area is now set to become houses, a hotel and a shopping center . Members of the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants gather on the field with their families and security personnel after an earthquake struck prior to game three of the World Series on October 17, 1989 . Joe Montana (above in 1989) led the 49ers to four Super Bowls while playing at Candlestick . While Candlestick began as the home of the Giants, it also became home to the 49ers beginning in 1971. It had previously served as the home field for the Oakland Raiders for part of the 1960 and all of the 1961 season, but it was the 49ers who truly made their mark. And in their 43 seasons at candlestick, no player was bigger to the organization than Joe Montana, who would ultimately lead the team to four Super Bowl victories, a quarterback record that is shared by only Terry Bradshaw and, very recently, Tom Brady. And while Candlestick never saw an actual Super Bowl, it did get to host eight NFC Championship games. Montana was of course not the only great to grace the field, with Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott, and Terrell Owens just a few of the other esteemed 49ers to play at Candlestick.

It was later said that the design of the stadium saved the thousands of fans who had turned out for the game. The Giants left however at the end of the 1999 season, and the 49ers after 2013, and the last appearance at the park came not from an athlete, but a musician.

    "input": "The Scottish Professional Football League has performed a U-turn by switching Rangers' final-day clash with Hearts back to Saturday, May 2. The league found itself at the centre of a furious row on Wednesday after announcing it had moved Gers' Tynecastle fixture with the Jambos to May 3 - 24 hours after their rivals for second place in the Scottish Championship, Hibernian, completed their campaign at Falkirk. The decision was made after TV broadcaster Sky decided to screen the match live but Hibs hit out at the change, claiming it would place the league's sporting integrity at risk as they jostled with Rangers for the play-off slots. Rangers' Marius Zaliukas (right) dribbles with the ball as Livingston's Jordan White (left) gives chase . Zaliukas (left) jumps highest to score his side's equalising goal during the 1-1 draw with Livingston . The three other clubs involved have all backed the Easter Road club's stance - but the SPFL released a controversial statement on Wednesday night admitting it was puzzled by the fall-out. It said: 'It is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise'. But now it has been forced to backtrack after Sky gave the league the thumbs up to move the Rangers-Hearts clash at Tynecastle back to its original date. All other Championship fixtures will now be moved to 12.15pm to match the kick-off in Gorgie. Confirming the move, a league spokesperson said: 'Following consultation between the SPFL, member clubs and broadcast partners regarding the final round of Championship fixtures over the weekend of May 2 and 3, Sky Sports has now suggested an alternative schedule for its televised Championship match that weekend. 'As a result, we are pleased to confirm all five Championship matches that weekend will now kick-off simultaneously at 12.15pm on Saturday, May 2. The Hearts v Rangers match will be televised live on Sky Sports. 'The SPFL would like to thank Sky Sports for its flexibility and understanding and we're sure all football fans will look forward to an exciting climax to the Championship season.' Speaking before the switch, Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan admitted if he had been in charge, Rangers and Hibernian would have always kicked off at the same time. Easter Road chief executive Leeann Dempster feared the rescheduling would give the Ibrox side an advantage as they would know exactly what kind of result would be required to clinch the runners-up slot - saving them the bother of two extra games in the play-offs. Regan refused to directly criticise his SPFL counterpart Neil Doncaster for allowing the fixture change which has sparked the drama in the first place - but he did admit his personal preference would be to have all teams battling for vital play-off spots played at the same time. Rangers' Kenny Miller (right) tussles for the ball with Livingston's Declan Gallacher (left) during the 1-1 draw . The SFA boss - who made his comments at the launch of the Football Memories project at Hampden - said: 'Sporting integrity is fundamental to any competition and I think that has to be considered in the round [of fixtures]. 'The clubs have made their feelings known and I'm sure Neil and his colleagues have listened to what their member clubs have said and come back with a pragmatic proposal. 'My preference in a play-off situation is having games finishing at the same time. 'It's not for me to stand here and criticise how another body has dealt with things. The clubs themselves have made their feelings known to the league. I know Neil and his colleagues have taken that on board and will do what they can to satisfy the various parties.' The row followed two days on intense negotiations with police and TV companies over the Premiership post-split fixtures and Regan added: 'Clearly the SPFL have come under pressure from a number of sources over the last 24/48 hours,' he said. 'But I'm sure Neil and his colleagues will be looking at the fall-out from the feedback they have received and trying to come up with a proposal. 'It's not helpful when you have negative issues being constantly played out in the press. When you get to the climax to the season, there is a lot at stake. 'It's never easy when you are trying to balance the needs of broadcasters, clubs, fans and sponsors but my view on this is that the fans come first and they have to be considered. I'm sure Neil will listen and come back with an appropriate and pragmatic solution.' Livingston's Scott Pittman (left) challenges Rangers' Dean Shiels (right) at the Energy Assets Arena .",

    "input": "The mother-in-law of one of one of the Boston bombers has taken to the stand to tell how her daughter was converted to Islam by her husband, as lawyers try to argue the other brother out of being put to death. Judith Russell, whose daughter Katherine married Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the two mass murderers who set of bombs at the 2013 Boston marathon, spoke at a court in the city today. Her words came as jurors decide whether Tamerlan's brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, should be put to death after being convicted of a host of crimes in connection with the massacre. Scroll down for video . On the stand: Judith Russell, pictured right in a 2013 file photo, took to the stand in the trial of Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. She told how her daughter Katherine, left, converted to Islam after meeting Dzhokhar's brother Tamerlan . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured three months after his arrest for the Boston bombing, flipping off a camera in his jail cell. His defense team argued on Monday he is a 'good boy' and should be spared the death penalty for killing three people and injuring several hundred in the 2013 terrorist attacks . Tamerlan himself was killed in a police firefight a few days after the bombing, which he masterminded. Change: Katherine Russell is pictured in a yearbook photo, before she converted to Islam . Defense lawyers for Dzhokhar have made the argument that he should not be killed because he was in some capacity forced into the killings by his more persuasive elder sibling. Russell was brought before the jury as a defense witness - and told how Tamerlan met her daughter and got her pregnant before gradually becoming more radical in her views. Russell told jurors she drifted from her daughter as a result of the relationship - and that at some point was shocked to find her wearing the veil and a new convert to her husband's faith. Though Russell admitted that Katherine seemed to take on the religion of her own volition - and still upholds it - her testimony indicated that he was the cause and she considered the move a sacrifice for him. At one point she revealed that Tamerlan, who was originally unemployed and unmotivated, became so zealous in his faith that he tried to force literature on her, too, and encourage her to convert. She told jurors that she has an Islam For Dummies book on her shelf at home, but couldn't remember who gave it to her. She said she had hardly met Dzhokhar or his family, but that she remembered attending a baby shower which the brothers' very religious mother attended. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, an ethnic Chechen, was . found guilty earlier this month of killing three people and injuring 264 as well as fatally shooting a police officer. David Bruck delivered the defense's opening statement in the penalty phase of Tsarnaev's trial, claiming that no punishment Tsarnaev can be given is equal to the suffering of the victims. Influencer? Defense lawyers for Tsarnaev (left) have said that his brother Tamerlan (right) drove his brother to help him with the 2013 killings . 'There is no evening the scales,' Bruck said. 'There is no point in trying to hurt him as he hurt because it can't be done.' During the initial stage of his trial, prosecutors portrayed him as an extremist who wanted to 'punish America' for military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries. The teen followed a blueprint from al Qaeda's Inspire magazine to build the homemade pressure-cooker bombs that ripped through crowds of spectators,volunteers and athletes on April 15, 2013. Bruck urged the jury to sentence the defendant to life in prison without the possibility of ever being released for his crimes. A chilling photo was revealed last week at the Boston bombing trial showing the aftermath of the blasts on Boylston Street . 'His legal case will be over for good, and no martyrdom, just years and years of punishment,' the lawyer said. 'All the while, society is protected.' Bruck told the court that Tsarnaev would be sent to a supermax prison in the Colorado mountains, adding that he would have no privacy, be under a video camera 24 hours a day. He would be allowed no interviews, there would be no autobiography and no messages relayed, the attorney added. Bruck focused heavily on Tsarnaev's  brother, Tamerlan, who died after a gunfight with police four days after the bombing, saying he led the plot and provided the 'fuel' to drive the plan. He said Tamerlan was 'consumed by jihad' and had 'power' over Dzhokhar, who admired his older brother. Bruck contrasted Tamerlan with Dzhokhar, saying Tamerlan was loud and aggressive, got into fights, failed at everything he did and never held a steady job, while Dzhokhar was a good student in high school, was loved by his teachers there, had many friends and never got in a fight. 'He was a good kid,' the lawyer said. But he said Tsarnaev started going downhill in college. One of the first defense witnesses to testify in the penalty phase described an incident at a mosque when  Tamerlan became angry and interrupted prayer services. Imam Loay Assaf testified on Monday that he got very angry during one service in 2013 when Assaf praised Martin Luther King Jr and compared him to the Prophet Mohammad. Assaf says Tamerlan interrupted the service, shouting at him and calling him a 'hypocrite'. Prosecutors have portrayed Tsarnaev as an unrepentant killer who gave the finger to the security camera in his jail cell three months after his arrest. The startling photo and video were shown to the jury last week. Bruck downplayed the gesture, saying Tsarnaev was 'acting like an immature 19-year-old'. Defense attorney, Judith Clarke, had opened the trial . with the blunt admission 'it was him,' Tsarnaev, who committed . all the crimes he was charged with. But she closed the guilt . phase by arguing that, when it came to planning the attack and . building the bombs, 'Tamerlan did that.' Defense attorneys Timothy Watkins, left, and David Bruck arrive at federal court on Monday during the penalty phase of the federal trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three and injured 260 people in April 2013 . In this courtroom sketch, bombing survivor Marc Fucarile, right,  was depicted on the witness stand on Friday during the penalty phase where he stared down Tsarnaev. Fucarile said he has had more than 60 surgeries, and it is still unclear whether his left leg can be saved . In a sharp contrast to the last phase of the trial, when the . defense took just two days to call four witnesses, the court has . scheduled about two weeks' worth of testimony as Tsarnaev's . lawyers make the case to spare his life. Few details are known about who the defense lawyers will call to . testify as all witness lists in this trial have been filed under . seal. On Thursday, local media reported that some members of . Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston. It is not clear exactly which members of his family traveled . to Boston or if they will testify or simply observe the . proceedings. Another unanswered question is whether Tsarnaev will speak . in his own defense. He has been a quiet presence during the . trial, offering no signs of emotion as the jury heard sometimes . tearful testimony from survivors and viewed graphic, disturbing . images of the bombs' detonation and aftermath.

A little more than a month before her husband, Bernard Freundel, is set to be sentenced for his crimes, his wife Sharon Freundel held a lecture at a Maryland Jewish school about how to respond to traumatic experiences. While Mrs Freundel did not directly address her personal drama, she did allude to the scandal which shocked her community at the beginning of the talk. 'As you all know, I've become an expert in PTSD,' Mrs Freundel told the room of about 150 people, according to the Washington Post.  'Researching this has been so therapeutic.' Sharon Fruendel (right), wife of disgraced D.C. Rabbi Bernard 'Barry' Freundel (left) gave a speech on March 22 which alludes to her family's recent scandal. In October, her husband was charged with spying on dozens of women who changed in their synagogue's ritual bathroom . It was in October that Sharon's husband Bernard 'Barry' Freundel was arrested after a police investigation revealed he had spied on dozens of women who changed in the ritual mikvah bathrooms at the Kesher Israel Congregation synagogue in D.C. Freundel first came under investigation when a woman changing came across a suspicious  clock radio in the bathroom which is used mainly by people converting to Judaism and Jewish women to cleanse following menstruation. In February, the 63-year-old rabbi pleaded guilty to 52 misdemeanor charges of  voyerism and he is set to be sentenced on May 15. In the weeks following her husband's arrest, Freundel left D.C. for Maryland, where one of her daughter's lived. While her husband has granted her a Jewish divorce, the two are still legally married. On March 22, she spoke to the group fathered at Charles E Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland,  for about 90 minutes. During the talk she cited several instances of 'trauma' in the Hebrew bible and how the biblical figures responded to their crises as lessons for life. She seemed to address her own personal issues with her husband when she quoted Jewish philosopher Joseph Soloveitchik, who wrote that marriage is a place people can go 'when we believed nobody 'gets' us.' Barry Freundel pleaded guilty to 52 counts of misdemeanor voyeurism in February. He is set to be sentenced in May. Pictured above leaving D.C. Superior court on February 19 . However, Soloveitchik ends by saying that ultimately, the answer 'is to turn to the one above. The one above will get it.' Several members of the Kesher community were in attendance to hear Freundel talk, and respected her more for it. 'She didn't want to represent the scandal anymore,' one longtime Kesher member told the Post. 'It gave her sense of how she survived it and how the community can survive it. She was educating the community in surviving its misfortune.' Mrs Freundel is also the director of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at the Jewish Primary Day School in northwest D.C. Prosecutors said Freundel recorded the women between early 2009 and October 2014 using devices installed in two changing rooms for the National Capital Mikvah, which is next to the Kesher synagogue. Investigators found six video files of nude women, with one showing Freundel's face as he set up the camera, prosecutors said. Police searched his home and his office at Maryland's Towson University, where he was an associate professor, and seized computers, electronic devices, remote controls, hard drives and cameras hidden in a fan and a tissue box, they said. Prosecutors said at least 52 women were recorded nude or partially nude on 25 different dates from March 2012 to September 2014. Voyeurism carries a three-year statute of limitations. Investigators also found that Freundel secretly recorded about 100 more women between 2009 and September 2014 in a bathroom at the National Capital Mikvah, they said. Each of the 52 counts of voyeurism carries a penalty of a year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000, or $2,500 for those committed after June 2013. One of the victims, Stephanie Doucette, said in a statement: 'I continue to be profoundly shocked and upset by Rabbi Freundel's outrageous conduct, which violated the security, trust and beliefs of so many women.' Freundel is also facing civil lawsuits and was fired from Kesher Israel in December. His congregation has included Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.",

Now, nearly two months after her departure, Amira has shared a snippet of life in the Islamic State - posting an online photo of her enjoying a takeaway dinner with another teenage 'jihadi bride'. Scroll down for video . ISIS spread: London schoolgirl Amira Abase, 15, has tweeted from inside the Islamic State for the first time (above), bragging about a Western-style takeaway dinner of fried chicken, chips, pizza and kebab meat . Until recently, the Twitter account of 15-year-old Amira was set to private. The recent public tweet from the radicalised teenager gives a unique insight into the life of the British runaways. It shows a huge Western-style takeaway, including fried chicken, chips, pizza and kebab meat. Amira - tweeting under the name Bintt Abbas - captioned the photograph 'dawla takeaway w/ @um_ayoub12'. 'Dawla' is another name for the Islamic State, which is also known as Isis. 'Um-ayoub12' is the name of another Twitter user, who describes herself as a '16-year-old muhajirah'. She believed to be another of the dozens of western teenagers who have travelled from Europe to join Isis. Amira's dinner companion uses the same profile picture as the 15-year-old from Bethnal Green. Earlier this year the older girl tweeted: 'uh wanna behead some kafirs [non-Muslims] now'. Amira Abase, pictured last September, has tweeted from inside the Islamic State for the first time . Disturbing minds: Amira uses the same Twitter picture as another Western teen runaway, known only as Um Ayoub, who tweeted earlier this year that she wanted to 'behead some kafirs [non-muslims] now'. 'Jihadi brides': This picture is thought to show Amira and her fellow runaways - Bethnal Green Academy students Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, in a London park . Amira's Twitter account shows pictures of Amira's everyday life as a teenager in East London in the months before she left for Syria. They include snaps of her building a tower out of neon highlighter pens during a revision session at Bethnal Green Academy as well as several pictures of the London skyline, which appear to have been taken from her family home. The GCSE pupil also shares her love for Vans and Nike trainers and Chelsea FC. She also appears to be a fan of the Cookies & Cream dessert cafes, tweeting a picture taken in its Whitechapel branch and declaring it has 'the best waffles'. Before her departure to Syria, she tweeted a poignant picture of herself with two friends, believed to be fellow runaways Shamima Begum  and Kadiza Sultana, before their departure. It shows the trio sitting in a London park, and is captioned 'Akhwaat', meaning 'sisters' in Arabic. Earlier this week, it was reported that Abase and her two classmates had joined the fearsome group of British female jihadis who run Isis's ultra-religious police force. Normal teen: As Amira's Twitter account has become public, it also gives an insight into her life as a normal 15-year-old girl in East London, posting about shoes, waffles, sunsets and Chelsea FC . Shoe fan: Several of Amira's tweets from before her departure reference her love for trainers, such as Nike Air Force. In one message she asks her followers whether she should buy a new pair of Vans . Sweet tooth: The 15-year-old posted about her visit to a London branch of Cookies & Cream in December . Runaways:  Amira, left, and her classmates Kadiza Sultana,16 and Shamima Begum, 15 are caught on CCTV at Gatwick airport before they boarded their flight to Turkey two months ago . Londoners Kadiza Sultana (left) and Shamima Begum are thought to be in Raqqa too, along with Amira . Concerns: The three East London schoolgirls are believed to have joined the fearsome group of British female jihadis who run the al-Khansa brigade - Isis's ultra-religious police force . Shamima Begum has forged social media links with three of the British leaders of the al-Khansa brigade – an all-women militia set up by the terror group a year ago. It is understood the trio are now training with one of the notorious female arms of Isis. Covered in black from head to toe and wielding automatic weapons, the group has been accused of doling out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa, and spying on its citizens. They are said to mercilessly patrol the streets of the terror group's adopted capital, and have previously declared that children as young as nine should be married. They say women should obey men – who are their masters – and remain 'hidden and veiled' at all times. The group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force, monitoring the behaviour of females in the city and dishing out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black or veils made from the 'wrong' material. According to Syrian activist group 'Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently', the female fanatics are feared by local women due to their use of torture.",

DeShawn Isabelle punched the 41-year-old woman in the head from behind and then dragged her to the ground by pulling on her hair before continuing to punch her in the head and face as she crouched in the fetal position, according to Assistant State’s Attorney Joe DiBella. Isabelle also stole $2,000 in cash that the woman was going to wire back to her family in Thailand and spent it on junk food, Air Jordan track suits and his graduation fees, DiBella said. Scroll down for video . DeShawn Isabelle, 15, has been arrested for allegedly robbing, beating and sexually assaulting a woman on a Chicago train after his mother recognized his face on surveillance images and turned him in to police . The middle school student was sitting in the otherwise empty carriage when the woman boarded the CTA train in Oak Park on Monday at 3pm, according to the Chicago Tribune. During the brutal beating, Isabelle put his hands inside the woman's pants and sexually assaulted her, according to DiBella. The teen also allegedly groped the woman over her clothes and slapped her buttocks and then sat on her head as he continued to beat her. Isabelle pinned the woman down with his knees when the train stopped at the next station, prosecutors said. When no one entered the carriage, he then dragged the woman by her hair to a partially enclosed area and continued to punch, kick and stomp all over the woman's body as he pushed her face down and demanded money, DiBella said. Isabelle then stole the woman's iPhone and got off on the Cicero stop to hop a train heading in the opposite direction, DiBella said the teenager later told authorities. The woman pushed the car's emergency button after the train began moving again and was attended to by CTA personnel. She was left with bruises and cuts all over her body as well as a concussion after the six-minute ride.

Aden Gould, 21, was also told to pay a £150 'security fee' after he was seen testing speakers on sale in a branch of the supermarket - even though he put the equipment back where he found it. The giant firm sent him an aggressive letter warning that staff would call the police if they ever catch him trying to enter Sainsbury's. Banned: Aden Gould, 21, was told he could not return to Sainsbury's after he opened some speakers there . Mr Gould, who has learning difficulties and is unemployed, went into the Sainsbury's branch in Stoke-on-Trent and opened two boxes containing £25 speakers. He then tested the gadgets to see if they worked with his mobile phone, and put them back on display - but was immediately apprehended by security. Staff took him into the manager's office and forced him to empty his bag, but he was cleared of shoplifting. Mr Gould later received a pair of letters saying that he was banned from all 1,200 Sainsbury's stores across the country, and had to pay £150 in compensation. However, the company has now backed down and agreed to revoke the ban, as well as waiving the £150 fine. He said: 'The first set of speakers didn't work and the second weren't very good so I put everything back in the boxes. 'I was walking out of the shop when the security guard grabbed me and took me into the manager's office. I was confused about what I'd done and I thought I was in trouble. 'I wanted to call my mum but they told me to put my phone away. I was scared and frustrated. I felt like I was having a heart attack. 'When I got outside I was really panicking. I was shaking all over. I then received a second letter saying I owed £150 in security fees but I had no idea what it was for.' Reversal: Sainsbury's has now revoked the ban which was imposed at its Stoke-on-Trent store, pictured . His mother Petra added: 'Aden was shaking uncontrollably when he got home and when he got the letter saying he was banned I went straight down there. 'An assistant told me he had committed criminal damage because he opened the boxes and said I was lucky the police weren't being called. 'I think staff initially thought he was a shoplifter but after he proved he had nothing in his bag they should have just let him go. He is being treated like some kind of criminal. 'If it is such a crime to open the little boxes, there should be a sign saying it is a criminal offence.' In its letter to Aden, Sainsbury's stated: 'The invitation to enter and shop at all Sainsbury's stores is permanently withdrawn due to the incident on April 15. 'Should you enter any of our premises you will be treated as a trespasser and the police will be called as necessary.' But after Mrs Gould complained, the company agreed to revoke the ban and told Aden that he was welcome to return. A spokesman said that the £150 fee, which has now been waived, was a standard charge to make up for the fact that the speakers which Mr Gould opened can no longer be sold. She added that the ban and fine had been imposed 'in error', saying: 'We have already been in touch with Aden to invite him back into store and look forward to seeing him soon.'",

    "input": "Discount store Aldi’s astonishing success story continued yesterday as it overtook upmarket rival Waitrose to become the sixth biggest supermarket in Britain. The German discounter has won an increasing share of the market since the recession as cash-strapped families look for cheaper alternatives. It now lags behind only the ‘big four’ – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons – and the Co-operative. Growth: Discount chain Aldi now has a bigger market share than upmarket supermarket Waitrose . Major supermarkets have slashed prices in recent months to fend off competition from cut-price rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Despite this Aldi has lifted its market share from 4.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent in the past three months. Waitrose has 5.1 per cent of the market, up from 5 per cent, according to consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Lidl claimed recently that Britain’s middle classes had become the ‘Lidl Classes’ after sales rose by a fifth in a year. But while Lidl remains eighth behind Waitrose, Aldi is now one of Britain’s mainstream supermarkets. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. This compares to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose, lifting its share of the market. The total market share of the ‘big four’ fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Aldi – motto Spend a little. Live a lot – stocks virtually all own-branded goods and offers a far smaller selection of goods. By contrast middle-class rival Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, focuses on customer service and high-quality produce. Increase: Consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from January and the end of March compared to the same time a year earlier, compared to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose . Aldi has 560 stores and hopes to double in size by 2022. Yesterday, it announced it was opening nine more stores in London, creating up to 600 jobs. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share. This is some way off Tesco’s dominant 28.4 per cent share, followed by Asda at 17.1 per cent. But Fraser McKevitt, at Kantar Worldpanel, said the success of Aldi and Lidl meant the entire structure of the ‘supermarket landscape’ was changing. The price war between upmarket retailers and discounters has led to significantly cheaper food. The Office for National Statistics says food prices fell by more than 3 per cent in February compared to a year earlier. Aldi began as a small food store opened by miner’s wife Anna Albrecht in the German town of Essen in 1914 to support the family when her husband became ill.",

Al Sharpton has denied that the family of police shooting victim Walter Scott have barred him from attending his funeral because it would cause a 'circus' of media attention. The controversial preacher and civil rights campaigner said a report that the family wanted him gone to avoid 'another Ferguson type of circus' is 'bogus'. He also announced that he would head to North Charleston, South Carolina, to preach and attend a vigil on Sunday, the day after the funeral. Allegations that Scott's family wanted nothing to do with Sharpton were published by the New York Daily News. In response, Sharpton said: 'There has never been a discussion about me attending or participating in the funeral on Saturday, since everyone knows that [National Action Network’s] convention with thousands of delegates is happening in New York and doesn't end until Saturday night.' Anthony Scott, the victim's brother, said today that the National Action Network has been working with the family since Walter Scott was shot on Saturday April 4. Incendiary cell phone footage showed Scott being gunned down from behind by Slager after he was pulled over for having a broken tail light. Slager was fired, arrested and charged with murder when the video came to light, reigniting tensions around policing which took center stage in Ferguson, Missouri, after teenager Michael Brown was killed. Family: The New York Daily News claimed that Sharpton's family asked him to stay away to avoid a 'circus'. He has said it is untrue . Incendiary: Scott was shot dead by Officer Michael Slager, right, in North Charleston, South Carolina. After video footage, above, emerged of the killing, Slager was charged with murder . Sharpton said the incident proves that a new law is necessary to compel all police officers in the country to wear body cameras while on patrol. He confirmed his intention Friday morning to preach at North Charleston's Charity Missionary Baptist Church. He said his message will be that justice should be pursued 'in a peaceful, legal way'. After giving a service, he said he will attend a vigil at the spot where Scott was killed. Sharpton's involvement comes after dashcam footage from Slager's patrol car was released, showing the traffic stop moments before the shooting. From before: This footage shows Scott running away from Slager after being pulled over in his car . Slager is seen confronting Scott over his busted tail light and asking for documentation, which Scott says he does not have. When Slager returns to his patrol car, Scott flees and the officer gives chase. It is not clear what happened in the time between the dashcam footage and the cell phone video. After the shooting it emerged that Scott was some $7,500 behind in child support payments. It had been reported that a warrant was out for his arrest for this reason - but that was later shown to be false. Vigil: Sympathizers laid flowers at a makeshift memorial in North Charleston at the spot where Scott was killed . Tributes: A man is pictured above adjusting flower displays and condolence messages in the grassy lot where Scott was killed . Records show that he last paid child support in July 2012. But there was no bench warrant directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge. Scott had been in jail three times over child support. In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. Family members have said he may have run from Saturday's traffic stop because he feared going back to jail over more back child support.",

Gonzalo Higuain twice came close to being put clean through on goal early in the second half while Jonathan de Guzman wasted another chance to break clear of the Lazio defence with a poor first touch. But Lazio, who face Juventus in the final, were also dangerous and went ahead 11 minutes from time when Felipe Anderson rolled the ball across the face of goal and Lulic beat three defenders to the ball to turn it in from six metres. The Bosnian, who scored the winner when Lazio beat AS Roma in the final two seasons ago, was also the hero at the other end when he cleared the ball off the line after a brilliant run by Lorenzo Insigne. Juventus overcame a first-leg deficit with a 3-0 win at Fiorentina on Tuesday. Earlier, last-place Parma beat Udinese 1-0 in a Serie A match that was postponed from February, when crisis-hit Parma was unable to provide basic stadium services like lighting and security.

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79),  Forshaw,  Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85),  Bamford, Garcia Martinez.

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved .",

    "input": "Since Herman Melville penned his novel Moby Dick more than 150 years ago, scientists have been fascinated by the remarkable attributes of the sperm whale and its kin - the smaller pygmy and dwarf whales. Now, fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago, have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales. The remains, which were discovered in Panama, indicate that the organ involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the whale’s evolution. Fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales. This image shows the right lateral view of the skull of Nanokogia isthmia . Although why this is so remains a mystery. While many whales, dolphins and porpoises have a long fossil record, enabling scientists to understand their evolution, there is limited evidence of sperm whales and smaller pygmy and dwarf whales, which are capable of navigating the ocean deep underwater. Now an international team of scientists, led by the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County has discovered a new species of extinct pygmy sperm whale, called Nanokogia isthmia, which clarifies key aspects of the evolution of these  animals. The  well-preserved skulls of two individuals were unearthed at a sea cliff along the Caribbean coast of Panama. The find will help experts fill in gaps in the evolution of cetaceans. This is the evolutionary tree of sperm whales showing links between extinct and living species, and when the spermaceti organ changed shape . The remains, which were discovered in Panama, indicate that the bone involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the evolution of the sperm whale. In contrast modern sperm whales (a stock image is shown) are much larger than their extinct relatives . The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It's only one of three living species in the sperm whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale. Mature males reach an average length of 52 ft (16 metres) with their head making up one third of their length. They mostly dine on squid and swim to depths of 7,380 FT (2,250 metres) to hunt for prey. They are the second deepest diving mammal, following only Cuvier's beaked whale. The sperm whale's clicking vocalisation - a form of echolocation and communication - can be as loud as 230 decibels underwater, making it the loudest sound produced by any animal. It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's and can live for more than 60 years. It reveals an unexpected level of complexity in the evolution of the spermaceti, which is an organ located within the head that plays a key role in the generation of sound and in the whale’s capacity for echolocation. The study, published in the journal Plos One, shows that at one time small sperm whales measuring  around seven feet (two metres in length) had a much larger spermaceti organ relative to their size than  modern day relatives. It got downsized at least twice during their evolutionary history, including the evolutionary event that gave origin to the living pygmy and dwarf sperm whales. Lead researcher Dr Jorge Velez-Juarbe said: ‘The new discovery gives us a better understanding of the ancient distribution of these poorly known relatives of the sperm whale. ‘Previously we knew of similarly-aged pygmy and dwarf whales from Baja California and Peru, but this new fossil fills in an important geographic gap in the group’s ancient distribution.’ He added: 'Our study is part of a larger scientific effort aimed at understanding the changes in the marine habitats that resulted from the complete closure of the Isthmus of Panama,' referring to the separation between the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea that took place sometime within the last 10 million years. The new fossil is known from the well-preserved skulls of two individuals which were unearthed at a sea cliff along the Caribbean coast of Panama, shown on this map . The fossils show that at one time small sperm whales measuring  around seven feet (two metres in length) had a much larger spermaceti organ relative to their size. A dorsal view of the fossilised skull is shown .",

    "input": "(CNN)Italians have a saying: \"Too much of something cripples it.\" We're overcrowded with so many frescoed churches, medieval castles and Roman ruins that we simply don't know what to do with them, let alone care for a proper upkeep. We've turned blind to their value and beauty. There are nearly 5,000 \"gems\" scattered across the country, ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments. Italy boasts the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in the world -- 50, several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources. And there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides, floods and natural calamities. The UNESCO-listed Basilica of Assisi, where St. Frances' tomb lies, is just the last of a series of national shames. Its frescoed walls by Renaissance masters including Giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle. In a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros. We're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value. I remember once an American colleague asking me: \"But what does Italy do with its immense cultural heritage\"? Good question. If other nations had half as much of what we boast, they'd make a much better job with it. Paradoxically, if we had just the Coliseum or Venice it would be easier. But we don't and trouble is Italy doesn't know how to exploit this treasure. Take the British Museum's successful exhibition on Pompeii in 2013: we have the real site in our backyard but the British made the best of it worldwide while the real Pompeii was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses. Or, worse, Italy couldn't care less to promote its assets. As a travel writer I have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it's a battle: many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places. I find myself almost begging them, when it should be the other way round. The true but sad thing is that restyling in Italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors. Crowdfunding has already saved Bologna's San Luca Portico. The Coliseum is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand Todd's, while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts. Yet it's not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity-driven measures. It's also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment, the care to cherish a country's valuable monuments. And that's because Italians have always lacked a sense of national belonging: Italy, despite its millenary history, is one of the world's most modern states, unified in 1861. Patriot Massimo D'Azeglio once said: \"Now that we've made Italy, we need to make Italians.\" Tough job indeed, and we're still a long way to go. There's also wide-spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general. Heritage authorities are in love with the Romantic ideal \"of decadent ruins\": better leave the monument or site as it is, even allow it to rot, rather than recover it and \"destroy its original beauty.\" Each time new subway works bring to light an unknown Roman theatre or necropoli, it all freezes - the public works and the artistic upkeep. Preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion. But that's a blind approach. There's so much Italy could do with what it has, that it could live off tourism.  Symbola Foundation estimates that culture and art, if well exploited, could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year, amounting to 15.3% of GDP. Another thorny issue is having a cheap culture. Entrance tickets to the Coliseum, Italy's top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists, cost a maximum of 12 euros. Matera's rock crypts are 5 euros. Not to mention churches featuring Michelangelo's works, which are free to enter. The first time I visited Westminster Abbey in London, and St. Patrick's church in Dublin, I was shocked to find out I had to pay to get in. And it was quite expensive, too. One could argue that Italy does well to open for free the Lord's doors, but probably in some \"critical\" cases a minimum cost to enter wouldn't hurt. The country's mindset needs to change, too. Monuments and works of art are not dead, but living things that deserve to be sexed-up once in a while. If we don't have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance, why not give them over to other countries to run? Or sell them to rich businessmen? Similar options make state authorities' hair stand on end: they stress art belongs to the Italian people and should remain in public hands -- even if it's inaccessible and unenjoyable. Yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private, thriving multimedia museum? The Uffizi Galleries' secret cellars are stacked with 2,500 forgotten masterpieces, which could be leased out to privates. Curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved. But cobwebs and dust can do no harm, right? Our sunny piazzas, bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities' coffers. And who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo? There are also 6,000 abandoned medieval \"ghost towns\" that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy. The state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years. Since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out, one being a Renaissance villa in Florence turned into a deluxe spa resort. Fine, Rome wasn't built in a day. But it could crumble in an hour.",

In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Francis Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing after being pursued several miles by the San Bernardino County officers. Seconds later, two deputies catch up to Pusok and stun him with their Tasers. They then stun him again, and again, as lies splayed face-down on the ground, with his arms placed behind his back. As the camera keeps rolling, the officers apparently kick the suspect in the head and crotch, before other deputies arrive on the scene. One clearly draws back his leg and swings it at Pusok's head. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: Ten deputies have been placed on leave after a horrific video emerged showing them punching and kicking (left) alleged horse thief Francis Pusok (right) following a chase through the southern California desert . Beating: In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing. Seconds later, the deputies catch up to him and stun him with a Taser, before beating him (above) Chillingly, after the beating, a deputy whispered in the suspect's ear: 'This isn't over,' according to Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell, who said the man was left 'scared to death for himself and his family'. Now, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon has placed 10 deputies on paid administrative leave for their alleged roles in the graphic footage, which he said had 'disturbed and troubled him'. McMahon said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation into the actions of the unidentified officers. 'I'm not sure if there was a struggle with the suspect,' he told NBC. 'It appears there was in the early parts of the video. What happens afterwards, I'm not sure of, but we will investigate it thoroughly.' In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office, McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave.' Earlier on Thursday, Pusok had allegedly fled by car after deputies had tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation. He later dumped the vehicle in the Hesperia area, it is said. Investigation: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon (pictured) said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation . Paid leave: In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office (pictured), McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave' Couple: Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner (left), said her boyfriend (right) has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted he is a great father, and said she 'couldn't believe' the filmed attack . The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing, then reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, before being tracked down by deputies. In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing. The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch. As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Following the incident, two deputies were taken to a nearby hospital for injuries, including abrasions, a twisted knee and a back injury from being struck by the horse, the sheriff's office said. Chase: The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing,  reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, on Thursday, before being tracked down by deputies . Apprehended: In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing . Pusok was treated at the hospital for abrasions and bruising. He was then released to be booked on suspicion of felony evading, theft of a horse, possession of stolen property and reckless driving. After the video was broadcast by NBC, it sparked outrage on the Internet, with many users noting that Pusok was lying on the ground in a 'surrender' position when he was beaten by the officers. On Friday, Mr Terrell told KABC that the attack seemed never-ending. 'This is as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King. This was terrible. It kept going and going and going,' he said. Rodney King, who died in 2012, rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers following a high-speed car chase in March 1991. Although four officers were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force, they were later acquitted in a series of verdicts that are thought to have caused the 1992 LA riots. 'Surrendering': The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch . Huddled around: As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Also Friday, McMahon said an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions in the arrest of Pusok. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. 'I'm asking for some patience while we complete a thorough and fair investigation,' McMahon said. 'I am disturbed and troubled by what I see in the video. It does not appear to be in line with our policies and procedures. Hospitalized: Pusok (pictured) was treated at a nearby hospital for abrasions and bruising . 'I assure you, if there is criminal doing on the part of any of our deputy sheriffs or any policy violations we will take action.' The deputies were wearing audio recorders, but McMahon said he had not listened to them and the recordings will be part of the investigation. Attorneys for Pusok told KNBC-TV Friday as they left the jail that their client has a badly swollen eye, marks from the beating over his face and body, and is in pain. 'He remembers being beat, and he remembers that he wasn't resisting, that he laid still, he complied immediately. He says that he didn't even move a muscle because he didn't want to be continuously beat, yet it still happened,' said attorney Sharon Brunner. Ken Cooper, a use of force expert, said the deputies were clearly frustrated and appeared to take that out on the suspect. One, he said, appeared to be striking Pusok with the Taser. 'It doesn't look good. It looks like his hands are behind his back even when they're doing the blows,' Cooper said. 'The justification for using force is to gain compliance from the suspect, and the suspect seems to be complying. So what this looks like is those blows are not justified, they're not necessary and they're not professional.' Cooper said the officers should be disciplined, retrained to deal with stress especially, and the video should be used for department-wide training. He said the officers allowed their emotions and adrenaline to overtake their professionalism. But training helps 'inoculate' officers from responding improperly during high-stress situations. 'When chasing a fleeing suspect, in high stress, you have to control that. It's your obligation as a professional. You can lose it sometimes,' Cooper said. McMahon said deputies had previously been called to Pusok's home in Apple Valley, where he had allegedly made threats to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of family members. 'We were very familiar with his aggressive nature,' McMahon said. Comparison: On Friday, Pusok's attorney, Jim Terrell, told KABC that the attack was 'as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King'. King (left, after his beating) rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers (right) following a high-speed car chase in March 1991 . Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, said her long-term boyfriend has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted that he is a great father who did not deserve the brutal beating. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she  said. 'I couldn't believe it,' Bindner said after seeing the video. 'The first thing I said was 'they cannot do that.'' The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.",

Filmmakers said they plan to use the latest digital camera technology as they venture from the planet's ice caps to ocean depths to deserts and remote forest. 'Our Planet' will focus on the Earth's last wilderness areas and the animals living there, the project's British producers said Wednesday. Audiences will have to be patient: The eight-part series will take four years to make and is planned for a 2019 debut for Netflix customers internationally. 'Our Planet' is being produced by U.K.-based Silverback Films in collaboration with World Wildlife Fund, an independent conservation group. Silverback company directors Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, whose credits include 'Frozen Planet' and 'African Cats' as well as 'Planet Earth,' will lead the production. 'We will reveal the most amazing sights on Earth and show them in ways they have never been seen before,' Fothergill and Scholey promised in a statement. The series is intended to wow 'global audiences with the wonder and importance of the natural world,' they said. 'Netflix is proud to be the global home for perhaps Silverback's most ambitious project to date,' said Lisa Nishimura of the streaming firm.

The firm hopes the show will boost usage of its ultra high definition 4K capabilities. 'We think watching Our Planet, fully on demand in 4K will be an unforgettable experience for our members.' World Wildlife Fund is opening its projects in protected areas to Silverback Films and will join with the company to create multimedia storytelling on WWF's website and other platforms. The series will introduce viewers to fragile habitats and 'precious species' and comes at a critical time for global conservation, said Colin Butfield, WWF executive producer. It also demonstrates the growing power of new-wave TV outlets like Netflix, which are claiming turf from traditional broadcast and cable outlets. 'Our Planet' predecessor 'Planet Earth' was created by Silverback for the BBC network in Britain and was a hit for Discovery channel in America when it aired in 2007.",

Sergeant Dan Urman's father Eitan Urman was so happy that as he embraced his son and lifted him off the ground, he slipped on the ice, causing both to tumble over while still hugging. As part of the planned surprise, Eitan and his wife Ronit, of Scottsdale, Arizona, had been invited to drop the puck before the Arizona Coyotes game against the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday. Scroll down for video . U.S. Army Sergeant Dan Urman embraces his father Eitan Urman after surprising him at the Arizona Coyotes game on Saturday . Eitan Urman sits in disbelief in seeing his son Dan, who has been stationed in Afghanistan since November of 2014 . The National Hockey League organization said they had won the puck drop because they have been season ticket holders for nearly 20 years. But when it was announced there'd be a special guest bringing them a ceremonial puck, the couple turned around to see their son Dan walking down the red carpet on the ice. Eitan immediately starts running toward his son, who had been in Afghanistan since November, as Dan jogs toward his father. When they embrace, Eitan lifts Dan off the ground and the pair fall to the ice and the carpet slides on the slippery surface. Once Dan stands up, his father sits on the ground for another moment with his hand on his head, still in disbelief. Eitan (left) and his wife Ronit Urman (right) were told they would drop a ceremonious first puck at the game on Saturday because they have been season ticket holders for nearly 20 years . And when they were told a special guest would bring out the puck for them, their son Dan ran out on to the ice . Eitan was so excited to see his son that he ran to meet him halfway down the red carpet as Ronit stood in shock with her hands to her face . Dan then hugs and kisses his mother and Eitan watches, smiling and embracing his wife and son. The trio make their way to the end of the carpet, pose for a photo then do the ceremonious puck drop for team captains, Ducks center Ryan Getzlaf and Coyotes forward Shane Doan. Dan told Daily Mail Online that he has been planning to surprise his family since he left in November. He was supposed to return to the states in mid-May or June, but contacted a rep from the Coyotes when he found out he’d be returning early, before the hockey season was over. ‘About two or three weeks ago they came up with the idea to tell my parents they won a random thing on fan appreciation night,’ Dan said. Eitan embraced his son and lifted him off the ground as they reunited for the first time since Dan left for Afghanistan . The father-and-son pair had a long embrace as a crowd of Arizona Coyotes and Anaheim Ducks fans cheered throughout the stadium . Eventually the pair lost their footing as the carpet moved on the slippery ice, and the fell to the ground, still hugging . He said he had help from the entire staff and team of the Coyotes, his sister, his girlfriend and other close friends who were all able to keep his surprise a secret from his parents. He said the whole event was ‘really cool’ and ‘surreal’, and it helped that his dad is an animated guy. ‘As he walked out, my father figured out there was no puck and he turned around,’ Dan said. ‘He recognized me immediately and so he dropped to a knee and I just sort of started jogging out to meet him.’ The crowd can be heard cheering as the family is reunited in front of thousands of people. Dan said his family had a chance to meet the Coyotes’ general manager after the reunion. Once Dan and Eitan stood up the son went to greet his mother, who he gave a hug and kiss to as his father hugged him fro behind . Eitan still looked shocked with excitement as they walked to center ice for the puck drop after the touching reunion . Though the Coyotes lost the game 2-1, it was still a celebratory night for the Urman family. This was Dan’s second tour of Afghanistan. He was there from March 2013 to November 2013. With no surprise planned, his parents planned to meet him on the east coast upon his arrival back to the states. His return was delayed, however, and he was stuck in Germany for a few days on his way back. ‘They had a nice vacation in Carolina,’ Dan said. ‘I thought it would be cool to surprise them this time.’ This was the Coyote's final game of the season. They finished seventh in the Pacific Division and will not be playing in the playoffs. The crowd cheered as Dan and his parents made their way to center ice. He waved at the crowd as Ronit and Eitan showed their sheer happiness of their son's return . Once in position at center ice, Dan, surrounded by his parents, dropped a ceremonious first puck for team captains, Ducks center Ryan Getzlaf and Coyotes forward Shane Doan to start the game .",

Mother-of-two Lindsey Norman noticed the uncanny resemblance in a six pack of £1 buns she had purchased from her local Sainsbury's in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Scroll down for video . Mother of two Lindsey Norman spotted the image of Jesus in the hot cross buns she bought from Sainsbury's . She said: 'I saw them and thought \"that looks just like a figure of Jesus with a sign of the cross on his shoulder\". 'It made me giggle to myself because it's coming up to Easter.' Ms Norman purchased the buns from the store and took them home for dinner that evening. She has since eaten all the buns in the packet. The shop assistant said it made me 'giggle' when she saw the uncanny resemblance with Easter coming up . This is not the first time the Saviour has been spotted in a peculiar sighting. Last week a California couple were shocked by the 'miraculous' appearance of Jesus on their pine dining table. Jaimie Beebe, 37, and her boyfriend Gary Ousdahl, 37, put the table on eBay with a $5,000 (£3,350) price tag - but it has yet to receive any bids. In the same week, hundreds of believers flocked to a hillside in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, when a landslide revealed the face of Jesus. Police had to be called in to control the crowds as Christians from across the country descended on the hill to witness the 'miracle'. In January last year, stunned dog owner Rachel Evans, 25, was bathing her mini Yorkshire terrier Dave in the bathroom sink when she spotted the image of Jesus in his ear. And in October, John Cranfield, 24, who lives in Manchester, inserted a slice of wholemeal bread into the toaster and was baffled when it popped out with the face of Jesus Christ. Mr Cranfield, a Catholic, said he was sure it is a message from God, adding: ‘As a strong Christian I believe that this was no mistake, I believe that God himself had sent it to me to prove that he exists and that I should not give up my faith.’",

    "input": "A SkyWest Airlines pilot plunged a plane carrying 75 passengers into a terrifying dive on Wednesday after a reported, potentially catastrophic loss of cabin pressure in mid-air. Frightened passengers held their heads and prayed as Flight 5622, operating as a United Express, dropped nearly 30,000 feet in eight minutes and made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York. The situation arose about an hour after take-off, when three passengers on the Embraer 175 twin-jet from Chicago to Connecticut  lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick. When the plane landed, SkyWest initially claimed that the aircraft landed 'out of an abundance of caution' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane. Late on Wednesday, the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that 'a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight'. Scroll down for video . Emergency responders came onboard SkyWest Flight 5622 after it made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday following a reported loss of cabin pressure . Mary Cunningham, a nurse, who was on board the flight assisted one passenger who passed out, getting her oxygen. She said that the plane did not land because of just one person's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell . Passenger Frank Angelo said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane 'nosedived' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes . 'You could feel something in the air, something just wasn't right,' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes. Passenger Larry Johnson, right, said: 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment' Emergency nurse, Mary Cunningham, said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint. 'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great,' said Cunningham to NBC Connecticut. Initially, reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight, leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure. When the plane landed at 11.40am, the FAA issued a statement saying the crew 'reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency', shortly before landing in Buffalo. However, in a second statement the FAA put out on Wednesday afternoon, there was no mention of a 'pressurization' issue. When contacted by the LA Times to explain this, a spokesperson for the FAA would not say why the change was made. However, an official with knowledge of the incident told the LA Times that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing 'rapid depressurization.' On landing this was declared untrue and SkyWest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight. SkyWest spokeswoman Marissa Snow said: 'There were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent, but I can't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.' SkyWest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft. Nose dive: Emergency vehicles surround a SkyWest Airlines plane, operating as United Express, that made an emergency landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport on Wednesday . Flight 5622, from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo . Passenger, Dave Barkley, 46, told the LA Times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious. Suddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over Detroit. 'They said there was a pressure problem with the plane,' he said. 'There was no door flying open or anything like that. It was something very gradual.' Barkley said that while the passengers were calm, he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made. 'The way SkyWest is reporting it is that someone got sick, and they had to land,' he told the LA Times. 'But the way we understand it, they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane.' A nurse flying on the Embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out. It was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks. 'The passenger was lethargic. She was responding but her color was off. She didn't look good. We got her some oxygen. She was much more alert after getting the oxygen,' the nurse, Mary Cunningham, tells NBC Connecticut. Cunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better. It was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out, as well. Then Cunningham, herself, took a turn.

I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great.' Passenger Larry Johnson said, 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment.' While another passenger said, 'you could just feel something in the air, something just wasn't quite right.' For nearly eight minutes, the plane descended at a very steep incline, dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute, while flying over Lake Erie, flight tracking service FlightAware said. The flight originated in Chicago and had been bound for Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. It landed at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. SkyWest Inc., which is based in St. George, Utah, said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released. An additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing, but none required treatment outside the airport, airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer said. 'Anyone who said they didn't feel well was treated at the gate,' he said. 'We want to understand the circumstances and what SkyWest knows before we decide what, if any, action we would take,' said Kelly Nantel, spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board. Snow said the plane's oxygen masks did not release. According to WKBW, one passenger said the plane 'nosedived' and crew told fliers that there was a loss of cabin pressure, but that turned out not to be true. SkyWest has 29 Embraer 175s in its fleet. The aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants. In a statement, the FAA said: 'SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 aircraft, landed safely at Buffalo International Airport at 11.40am after the crew declared an emergency.

    "input": "(CNN)Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's long-running sex abuse scandal, the Vatican announced Tuesday. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity. Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced. He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Two charges against his diocese were dropped. At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: \"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused.\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications. \"We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,\" Baker said. The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges. Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said. In those interceding months, the priest kept on working. And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction. The official website of the Catholic diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph still listed him as its bishop Tuesday morning. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese. \"It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,\" O'Malley said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview in November. \"There's a recognition of that ... from Pope Francis.\" Candida Moss -- a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana -- said it \"doesn't look very urgent\" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments. Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities. But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there. \"It kind of shook Francis' reputation,\" said Moss. \"Having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this, especially in the U.S., I think this is a typical Francis way to reinstall confidence.\" Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann. Under the Pope's directive, Naumann will be the Kansas City diocese's apostolic administrator, in addition to his regular responsibilities in Kansas, until a permanent bishop is appointed, according to an announcement on the diocese's website. \"I pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the Diocese,\" Naumann said in an open letter to parishioners. \"All of us, who are privileged to serve in leadership for the Church, do so for only a season. It is not our Church, but Christ's Church.\" Moss, the Notre Dame professor, predicted that the shuffling at the western Missouri diocese will be \"very well received,\" though some may question why it took so long. \"It's not just that it's late,\" Moss said, \"but it's that Francis could have been more explicit.\" To that point, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the Vatican's one-line announcement that Francis accepted the resignation \"in accordance with ... Canon Law.\" Anne Doyle, from the watchdog group that documents the Catholic church's abuse crisis, called Finn's removal \"a good step but just the beginning.\" \"The pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability,\" Doyle said. \"...

    "input": "Nine British Muslims caught trying to cross into Syria are no longer welcome in England and should find a new country to live, Labour's Simon Danczuk has said. The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey – including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family – including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children – are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 – who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago – served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul. Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed, pictured on his Facebook page with Labour Leader Ed Miliband just weeks before his son tried to cross into ISIS controlled Syria . Waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in Hatay southern of Turkey last week . He is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group. Mr Danczuk said the number of Britons fleeing the country to join ISIS – now thought to number more than 600 – exposed the failure of the Government's anti-terror strategy. He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization. 'I do not think the Government's Prevent strategy is working and we need a much smarter approach from all the authorities to stop this cancer spreading.'

Deputies said Nelson broke into a 53-year-old woman's home and demanded money.

Two children were at the home with the victim  at the time of the robbery, according to the television station. Nelson couldn't drive the car because of the manual transmission, however, and the woman used the emergency trunk latch to escape, authorities said.

The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.'

Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, was arrested Wednesday night at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after returning on a flight from Turkey. He has now been charged in a criminal complaint with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, Wisconsin (pictured left in his mugshot on Wednesday and right in 2010 when he registed on the sex offender's list) has been accused of flying to ISIS in a failed attempt to join ISIS . The criminal complaint, which had been under seal since Oct. 28, alleges that Van Haften talked to people about his plan before leaving the United States in August for Istanbul. The complaint cites Facebook posts from Van Haften that said he was unable to cross the border from Turkey into Syria. In one post, Van Haften complained that the people who were supposed to help him just wanted his money, that he had almost no cash left and that he was dropped off on a road in the country and never picked up. Wisconsin court records showed several previous convictions for Van Haften, including felony battery in 1998, second degree felony sexual assault in 1999 and disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in 2007, online court records show. He was apprehended at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday after getting off a return flight from Syria (file picture) All of the offenses occurred in Rock County. Van Haften was sentenced to three years' probation on the battery conviction in 1998, but his probation was revoked in 1999 and he was sentenced to a year in jail. He was sentenced to eight years' probation on the sexual assault charge in 1999, but that was revoked in 2000. He was then sentenced to seven years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Carlin from the Department of Justice said stopping people from traveling to the region to join the Islamic State is a 'top priority'. She said in a statement: 'Stemming the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and holding accountable those who attempt to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations remains a top priority for the National Security Division.

    "input": "A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

    "input": "It’s 11 years since Arsenal won the title. They went from Invincibles to Incapables. And you can throw bottlers into that description as well. Of course Chelsea could implode and hand the title to Arsenal over the next six weeks or so, but that’s unlikely. If it does happen it’s a title that’s long overdue and nothing can ever take away the barren years when Arsenal and Arsene Wenger were an embarrassment at home and abroad – specialists in failure. Those years will always hang heavy around Wenger’s neck. Yes, yes, there’s the FA Cup currently sitting there in the trophy cabinet alongside the shiny shield they won in August. And yes, yes, they are clear favourites to win it again. An FA Cup isn’t the definition of success for the great clubs of Europe. Only the Wenger apologists can’t see that. Olivier Giroud celebrates Arsenal's third goal by Alexis Sanchez in their win over Liverpool on Saturday . Arsene Wenger's Gunners now have 15 wins from 17 games since New Year's Day, but it's come too late . So are Gooners seduced by this end of season run they’re currently on? It’s impressive, no question. 15 wins in 17 games since their loss New Year’s Day. But this is classic Arsene Wenger isn’t it? After that defeat at Southampton on January 1 the Gunners were sixth in the table, 13 points behind leaders Chelsea. Wenger and the players felt they had no hope of winning the title, and so they started to play with freedom, and the wins kept coming. As soon as the pressure is off, Arsene Wenger looks like he can still do it. But once the pressure is on he crumbles, and his players lose their bottle completely. Sanchez drills his shot by Emre Can as Arsenal's impressive run continued against Liverpool . Per Mertesacker can't stop this shot from Sadio Mane as they fall 2-0 to Southampton on New Year's Day . The only two defeats in this current run were the two key games all Arsenal fans desperately wanted to win – at Tottenham and at home to Monaco in the Champions League: the two games with more pressure on them than any others on this run. They went to Monaco for the second leg with no pressure on them, everyone thought they were out, and so it proved. But with the pressure off, Arsenal turned it on. Arsenal are clearly a lot better than most of the teams they face. And they are now making the kind of signings they should be making – marquee players. So much is in place for real success to come. But the task for Wenger now is to show some balls, cope better when the pressure is on. And he and his players need to stop failing in certain games. Harry Kane celebrates his second strike in the 2-1 win for Tottenham over their North London rivals . Dimitar Berbatov scores the second of three away goals for Monaco that ruined Arsenal's Europe campaign . Dodgy results will happen to all sides of course. But I’m talking about the ones that should have been avoided. This season for example, if they’d won a game they were winning at Swansea, if they hadn’t been so desperately pathetic in the first half at Stoke, and if they’d kept the lead at 10-man Liverpool, Arsenal would be top. Those games and the circumstances of how they dropped points, have stopped Arsenal being serious title contenders this season. When you analyse it like that, you can understand the frustrations of the Arsenal fans after that Stoke defeat in December. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slumps to the ground as Arsenal bow out of the Champions League last 16 . Aaron Ramsey scores in the Gunners' 2-0 win at Monaco as they fell short again when it really counts . Arsene Wenger has been given time to fail repeatedly, and he’s still there. He now needs to make the most of his incredible good fortune and start earning his £8m a year as the fourth-highest-paid football manager in the world. Winning games when the pressure is off is something Wenger has proved he can do regularly. Now he needs to learn how to cope and succeed when the pressure is on. If he does that, then there really is no reason why Arsenal can’t win a major trophy, the kind of trophy that defines success for big clubs, and end an embarrassing period of failure for Arsene Wenger.",

    "input": "Aiming high: Nigel Farage visits an Army veterans' centre near Sandwich in Kent today . Nigel Farage last night held out an olive branch to David Cameron as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible Labour government. The Ukip leader called on Conservatives to vote tactically for him in seats where they cannot win in order to help keep the Tory leader as Prime Minister. And in the strongest hint yet that they could work together, Mr Farage dropped his demand that the Tories ditch Mr Cameron before any post election deal. In a direct appeal to Tory voters, Mr Farage said he believed many were in 'their hearts' closer to his position of wanting an EU referendum as soon as possible without any attempted re-negotiation. Mr Farage also revealed that he has already held informal discussions with Tories about potential post-election arrangements. Yesterday, as he launched his party's manifesto, Mr Farage called on Mr Cameron to join with him to lock Ed Miliband and the SNP's Alex Salmond out of Downing Street. Ukip has reduced its list of targets to just ten seats as it has been squeezed in the polls, but Mr Farage believes in seats such as Great Grimsby and Dudley North it has a better chance than the Tories at snatching them from Labour. Asked if it was time that Conservative supporters realised that Ukip could help them stop a Labour government, Mr Farage said they needed to vote tactically. He said: 'One of the things I have completely failed to understand is how the Conservatives would want to say vote Ukip get Labour in constituencies like Grimsby and Rotherham and Dudley North and all those Labour seats in which we are the challenger. I just don't understand it.' He warned that a Labour-led government backed up by the SNP 'would not be a very good thing for the country'. Asked if he and Mr Cameron could 'lock out' Mr Miliband and Mr Salmond from Downing Street, he replied: 'Well if that were possible then we would try and do that.' Farage looks at items being made in the wood craft room as he meets veterans and staff during a visit to the Futures for Heroes centre in Kent . The Ukip leader called on Conservatives to vote tactically for him in seats where they cannot win in order to help keep the Tory leader as Prime Minister . Farage shakes hands with Andrew Ferris, a former soldier with the Princess of Wale's Royal Regiment . Mr Farage previously said that Mr Cameron would need to step down as Tory leader before he could do any sort of post-election deal. But yesterday he said there would be no problem working with Mr Cameron personally. Mr Farage revealed he has already held informal discussions with Tories about potential post-election arrangements . He said: 'Albeit reluctantly, David Cameron has been forced into making a pledge on a referendum. There are circumstances in which we could do a deal with him but the referendum has got to be a proper one and not in 2017.' Mr Cameron a fortnight ago urged Conservative supporters who have defected to Ukip to 'come home' and pleaded with them not to use their vote in the General Election as a 'protest'. Yesterday asked what his message was to Tory voters, Mr Farage called on them to work with him to bring forward the referendum Mr Cameron has promised on EU membership by 2017. He made a reference to comments by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, that any meaningful renegotiation would not be possible until 2019. He said: 'I've said from the start there is no re-negotiation of any value whatsoever and it would appear that my old mate Mr Juncker is backing that up. 'The idea that we would need to wait for two or more years for a referendum is not something that I find acceptable.' Mr Farage said he would also want the Tories to match his commitment to Nato's target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence. He admitted that he had already been involved in 'informal' discussions with those in other parties about possible deals. As well as an early referendum on withdrawal from the EU, the Ukip manifesto promised a radical reduction in immigration, increased spending on defence and an £18billion tax giveaway. A journalist was heckled at UKIP'S manifesto launch after he asked why there was only one black person in the policy document. The party's supporters jeered at the reporter as he noted there were 27 white people pictured, but only one non-white person in the 76-page manifesto. A black woman is shown with Ukip's overseas aid spokesman Nathan Gill in a section setting out how the party would cut up to £11billion a year from the foreign aid budget. The reporter asked Mr Farage: 'Are you happy the only black face is on the overseas aid page?' Mr Farage did not answer as Ukip supporters jeered. A group of black and Asian party activists were then cheered as they stood up in the middle of the event. A journalist who asked about Mr Farage's remarks on stopping foreigners with HIV entering the UK for treatment was also heckled.",

    "input": "A Russian-Ukrainian film about a legendary Soviet sniper nicknamed 'Lady Death' is aiming to be a hit in both nations despite the crisis that has turned the former allies against each other. Titled 'Battle for Sevastopol' in Russia but 'Indestructible' across the border in Ukraine, the movie – about a female sharpshooter who reportedly killed more than 300 Nazi troops – is a co-production between the two countries made just before relations nosedived. And despite the freeze in ties between the former Soviet nations that has seen Ukraine ban a slew of modern Russian films, the $5million (£3m) movie was launched last week with glitzy gala premieres in both Moscow and Kiev. Scroll down for video . Nazi killer: A Russian-Ukrainian film about legendary Soviet sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko (left) who was nicknamed nicknamed 'Lady Death' is aiming to be a hit in both nations despite the current crisis. The film (right) is titled 'Battle for Sevastopol' in Russia but 'Indestructible' across the border in Ukraine . Will it bring unity? The movie – about the female sharpshooter who reportedly killed more than 300 Nazi troops – is a co-production between the two countries made just before relations nosedived . Director Sergei Mokritsky, who grew up in Ukraine but lives in Russia, told AFP: 'Despite everything, it has been accepted both by the new Ukrainian authorities and our Russian ones. 'I am hoping this film will unite people and at least for two hours, for the length of this film, people can come together in our shared history.' The Russian-language film is about Ukrainian-born sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko – nicknamed 'Lady Death' – and comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in May of the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War Two. Trained as a sharpshooter and sent to fight on the frontline in 1941, aged 25, Pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 Nazis in less than a year during battles in Odessa and the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Hard-hitting biopic: Russian actors Yevgeny Tsyganov (left) and Yulia Peresild (right), who plays Ukrainian-born sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko are seen in a still from Sergei Mokritsky's 'Battle of Sevastopol' film . Bringing together a shared history: The Russian-language film (above) comes out ahead of the 70th anniversary in May of the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War Two . Heroine: Pavlichenko was said to have killed 309 Nazis in less than a year during battles in Odessa and the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula during World War Two . Lyudmila Pavlichenko was sent to the frontline in 1941 at the age of 25 after being trained as a sniper. An unyielding character, she is said to have killed no fewer than 309 Nazis during the sieges of Odessa and later the strategic city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. It is said she once lambasted a fellow sniper for firing a shot than ended the agony of a dying Nazi, saying: 'They don't deserve an easy death.' She then falls for a fellow sniper and the couple plan to marry, but she is devastated when he, too, is killed. Finally she is evacuated from Sevastopol after getting injured, soon before the Nazis captured the strategic city in 1942. Sensing her propaganda value, the Soviet Union then sent her to tour Canada and the United States, where she called for the opening of a new front in the war. Dressed in an army tunic and cap, she became an object of fascination, nicknamed 'Lady Death' by journalists. She met American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and was invited to stay at the White House as a personal guest. The women stayed in touch and Roosevelt met her again years later in Moscow. The new biopic was shot on location in Sevastopol in November and December 2013 during the Maidan popular uprising in Kiev, shortly before the toppling of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and Russia's annexation of Crimea. 'I thought we can't stop filming, whatever happens,' Mokritsky recalled. 'The faster, the better, because later, it may not be possible.' The differing titles for the film highlight some of the bitterest divisions between Russia and Ukraine. In Russian, the title 'Battle for Sevastopol' resonates with the patriotic fervour generated by Crimea's annexation in March last year. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian name 'Indestructible' hints at the national spirit as government forces battle a pro-Russian uprising in the country's east. As played by Yulia Peresild, the film's heroine is unsmiling and unremittingly tough. 'War's no place for cowards,' she says. She vows to \"kill 100 enemies\", hugging her rifle and upbraids a fellow sniper for firing a shot to finish off a Nazi dying in agony. \"They don't deserve an easy death,\" she says. In graphic battle scenes with blood spurting and shells exploding, she shoots to kill without flinching. But she has a softer side, too. She finds love in the arms of a tough commander, who is killed soon afterwards. She then falls for a fellow sniper and the couple plan to marry, but she is devastated when he, too, is killed. Finally she gets injured and is evacuated from Sevastopol, soon before the Nazis captured the strategic city in 1942. The next stage in Pavlichenko's life is far from the horrors of the frontline. Sensing her propaganda value, the Soviet Union sent her to tour Canada and the United States, where she called for the opening of a new front in the war. Dressed in an army tunic and cap, she became an object of fascination, nicknamed 'Lady Death' by journalists. Pavlichenko was trained as a sharpshooter and sent to fight on the frontline in 1941 at the age of 25 . She met American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and was invited to stay at the White House as a personal guest. The women stayed in touch and Roosevelt met her again years later in Moscow. In the film, she reveals her emotional turmoil while cooking borscht with a motherly Roosevelt, played by British actress Joan Blackham. The film comes hot on the heels of the global smash directed by Clint Eastwood about a U.S. Navy Seal sharpshooter 'American Sniper'. Critics have lauded the vivid photography in the Ukrainian-Russian film, but complain that Pavlichenko does not come across as a fully-rounded character. 'She faces all these events with the same tense expression,' wrote Gazeta.ru news site. As for the two governments now locked in a bitter feud, both say they are rooting for the film to be a success - just not quite for the same reasons. 'We see it as a Ukrainian film,' a spokesman for Kiev's state film agency told AFP, saying that 79 percent of the film's financing is Ukrainian, both from the state and private investors. Meanwhile in Russia, an unusually conciliatory Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said he hoped the movie might remind the rivals of when they fought side by side. 'It's very important today that it's a Ukrainian-Russian co-production. This is a film about our shared victory,' Medinsky said. SIEGE OF ODESSA: . The Ukrainian city of Odessa was subjected to an unrelenting aerial bombardment by the Nazis and their Axis allies in June 1941. Surrounded on three sides, it was anticipated that Soviet forces would succumb quickly, but a channel via the Black Sea allowed for supplies and reinforcements to make their way into the city. A second onslaught began in mid-August, but was forced to halt around a week later for a few days because of heavy casualties at the hands of the Red Army.

However, by September 15, Soviet troops began to fall back towards the city and by early October, Moscow ordered a retreat. In the first two weeks of October, more than 120,000 troops were evacuated, along with 1,000 trucks and 20,000 tons of ammunition. On October 15, Romanian troops – part of the Axis alliance – entered the city. The Romanians lost nearly 18,000 troops while the Soviet Union lost around 16,000. Source: World War II Database . BATTLE FOR SEVASTOPOL: . Sevastopol, a key port city on the Black Sea, came under attack from five Nazis divisions, supported by Luftwaffe bombardments, in May 1942. Soviet troops were battered by up to 1,800 aerial sorties a day and were outnumbered by two to one on the ground. The Soviet Coastal Army, led by General I.E. Petrov, mustered 106,000 men, 600 artillery guns, 100 mortars and 38 tanks. German sappers at Sevastopol, where a massive siege was launched against the Soviet Red Army . The Germans, meanwhile, assembled 204,000 men, 670 artillery guns, 720 mortars, 655 anti-tank guns, 450 tanks and 600 aircraft. By the end of June, the Germans fought their way into the city and an evacuation of Russian forces in the city was ordered on June 30, lasting for four days. By the end of the siege, 90,000 Russian prisoners had been taken and they lost the equivalent of two armies. Source: History Learning Site .",

    "input": "A second ice cream company has recalled all of its products after health officials found listeria in a sample of its frozen treats. Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams of Ohio said on its website on Thursday that it is recalling its frozen products after the listeria discovery. In an online statement, Jeni's said it is taking the voluntary precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety. The company is recalling its ice creams, frozen yogurts, sorbets, and ice cream sandwiches and closing retail stores until its products are 'ensured to be 100 per cent safe'. Scroll down for video . Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams of Ohio announced on Thursday that it has initiated a voluntary recall of all of its ice creams, frozen yogurts, sorbets and ice cream sandwiches . In an online statement on their website, the company wrote it is ceasing all sales and closing all scoop shops until all products are ensured to be 100 per cent safe . Half of Jeni's shops are in Columbus, others are listed in Atlanta; Chicago; Charleston, South Carolina; Cleveland; Los Angeles; and Nashville, Tennessee. The Nebraska Department of Agriculture found the listeria in a sample of Jeni's ice cream it had randomly collected at a Whole Foods in Lincoln, Nebraska. 'We will be working with our suppliers to determine if the bacteria was introduced by one of the ingredients we use,' John Lowe, the company's CEO said in a statement. 'We will not reopen the kitchen until we can ensure the safety of our customers.' Jeni's said the recalled ice cream was distributed in the United States to retail outlets, including food service and grocery stores, as well as online at jenis.com. On Facebook, the company wrote that they are taking this precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety . The recall includes all products bearing the brand name 'Jeni's.' The action follows a similar recall by Texas-based Blue Bell Creameries on Monday night. Blue Bell's ice cream was linked to ten listeria illnesses in four states, including three deaths, and listeria was found in several of the company's products. The company is the third largest ice cream manufacturer in the US and sells its products in 23 states. It said it 'can't say with certainty' how the bacteria was introduced to the manufacturing line, Blue Bell's chief executive Paul Kruse said in a statement. 'We're committed to doing the 100 percent right thing, and the best way to do that is to take all of our products off the market until we can be confident that they are all safe,' Kruse said. On Monday, Texas-based Blue Bell creameries issued a voluntary recall for all of its products on the market on Monday night after two samples of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream tested positive for listeriosis . Just last month the family-owned creamery issued its first recall in its 108-year history after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked ice cream contaminated with listeriosis to three deaths at a Kansas hospital. Five others in Kansas and Texas were sickened with the disease. The foodborne illness was tracked to a production line in Brenham, Texas, and later to a second line in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. The recalls are uncommon: listeria isn't usually found in ice cream, since the bacteria can't grow at freezing temperatures. A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration said the agency has no evidence, for now, that the listeria found in Jeni's ice cream and the listeria found in Blue Bell ice cream are connected. 'At this time, the FDA does not believe that the finding of listeria in one sample of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams is related to the outbreak and recall associated with Blue Bell Ice Cream,' said spokesman Jeff Ventura. 'We are continuing to investigate both situations and will provide updated information to consumers as we learn more.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there are no known illnesses linked to Jeni's products. Listeria generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and their newborn infants . Also on Thursday, Blue Bell Creameries said it will close its facilities in Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama for intensive cleaning.  The creameries will be closed next week and possibly into the following week. The FDA said it still has open investigations in all three plants and will evaluate Blue Bell's progress in removing listeria from the plant and its products. Blue Bell did produce some ice cream in its plants this week, but that product will be used for testing and data gathering and won't be sold to the public, the company said. Listeria generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and their newborn infants. It can cause fever, muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms. The worst cases are fatal. The bacteria is found in soil and water that can be tracked into a facility or carried by animals. It can be very difficult to get rid of once it contaminates a processing facility, partly because it grows well in refrigeration. It is commonly found in processed meats, unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk, and it is sometimes found in other foods as well — listeria in cantaloupes was linked to 30 deaths in a 2011 outbreak. What is Listeria? Listeria is a hardy bacteria found in soil and water that can be tracked into a plant or carried by animals. It can be very difficult to get rid of once it contaminates a processing facility, partly because it grows well in refrigeration. It is commonly found in processed meats, unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk, and it is sometimes found in other foods as well — listeria in cantaloupes was linked to 30 deaths in a 2011 outbreak. It is less well-known than other pathogens like salmonella and E. coli, which cause many more illnesses in tainted food every year. But one in five people who get sick from listeria can die. The people who get sick from listeria are often already weaker and more vulnerable to disease. What are the symptoms? When a person contracts the disease, it can cause fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms and even death. Am I at risk? Listeria generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems and pregnant women. It can cause miscarriage, stillbirth and premature labor for women and serious illness or death in newborn babies. Healthy, younger adults and most children can consume listeria with no ill effects or only mild illness. How can I protect against listeria? In the case of the ice cream and hummus recalls, there is nothing you can do to prevent it — just throw away the food if you learn it has been recalled. With fruit, scrubbing is never a bad idea, but it may not rid produce of all contaminants. In the case of the cantaloupe, the listeria likely hid on the fruit's thick, rough skin. Health officials think people may have been sickened when people cut into their cantaloupes, bringing listeria on the outside of the fruit to the inside. Always clean surfaces that come into contact with food with hot, soapy water. The government says the listeria bacteria can be killed by heating food to 165 degrees Fahrenheit or until it is steaming hot just before serving it. Source: Associated Press .",

    "input": "At the helm of the NYPD from 1934-45 was Lewis Valentine (pictured), a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years who had a reputation for brutality . Today they are everyday heroes, New York's finest, but the New York Police Department has had a more chequered past than most would imagine. Bernard Whalen's new book 'The NYPD's First Fifty Years' is a tale of kickbacks, mob violence and secret KKK members. Whalen charts the early rise of the world renowned police department from it beginnings in 1898 when the New York area's 18 independent police forces merged into one. A variety of men led the force through its formative years, 21 in total. Some were forward looking, some were practical but more than a fair share were scoundrels, larcenists or at the very least guilty of dereliction of duty. The department's first chief of police, William Devery, who held the post from 1898-1901, was known as the king of kickbacks. A former bar tender, Devery had to give a backhander just to get into the force, and was never shy about trading dollars for ranks, the New York Post reported. Police officers of the time had to pay exorbitant fees, more than year's starting salary to become a captain, but for Devery the under the table payments could easily be recovered through other means. In his early career, when taking command of a lower East Side Police Precinct, Devery was recorded as saying that there was a great deal of 'grafting' going on among his subordinates and that he would put a stop to it so he could line his own pockets. On the back of bribes paid to him Devery was able to buy a baseball team, the New York Highlanders, a forerunner to the New York Yankees, which he eventually sold for $300,000 in 1915. Theodore Bingham who held Devery's former post from 1906 to 1909 had his own unique set of character traits and is described in 'The NYPD's First Fifty Years' as being pathologically blunt. A former Brigadier General, Bingham lost his leg in an Army engineering accident in Buffalo. He worked throughout his career to remove special civil service protections on police inspectors who he could not promote or demote. When he won his battle to fire the people he wanted he turned his attention to NYPD captains who had the same status. He was recorded as saying 'I wish that about 40 police captains would die overnight. They are no good.' Bingham's tendency for indiscretion landed him in hot water again when he let slip the whereabouts one of his top lieutenants who had become famous for tracking down the mob. The police chief decided to tell reporters that his star lieutenant was on a secret mission in Italy tracking down the criminal backgrounds of Mafioso, Black Hand members. The officer was later found, shot dead outside a Palermo café. Devery (left) was the king of kickbacks while Theodore Bingham (right) was 'pathologically blunt' Richard Entright who presided over the NYPD from 1918 to 1925 has become infamous for his decision not to root out Klu Klux Klan members in his own force. He was handed orders from the then mayor of New York to look into allegations that one of the city's Baptist ministers was allowing the white supremacist group to recruit from among his parishioners. The extent of KKK influence in the city was far greater than either Entright or Mayor John Francis Hylan knew and an astonishing 800 suspected Klansmen were found to be living in New York – 30 of them were police officers. Richard Entright (pictured) failed to even try and remove the KKK from within his own police force . Presented with the size of the problem and information that as far as it was known none of the individuals had broken the law, Entright decided to do nothing. Joseph Warren, chief of police for only one year from 1927 to 28 became famous for incompetence rather than any particularly nefarious acts. Upon the death of Arnold Rothstein, once New York's most notorious gangsters and the real-life inspiration for F. Scott Fitzgerald's character, Meyer Wolfsheim, in 'The Great Gatsby', warren told his top detective to take a holiday. Warren, who it has emerged may have suffered from mental problems, fumbled the open and shut case and, as Warren was pushed from his post, the key suspect walked free. At the helm of the NYPD from 1934-45 was Lewis Valentine, a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years. Valentine, whose autobiography was appropriately titled, 'Nightstick' and who would later host a radio show, 'Gang Busters,' was the embodiment of a tough cop. Under his tenure NYPD officers were encouraged to mercilessly beat their suspects and promotions were on offer to those who could – in Valentine's words 'throw the gorillas around'. Following the slow death of one officer who had been killed a week earlier Valentine ordered his men to shoot 'wise guys' on sight, telling them they shoulf 'draw quickly and shoot accurately'.",

Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . His brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were among the 54 Bradford supporters and two Lincoln supporters who did not survive. Fletcher, who was 12 at the time became determined to challenge the accepted theories which he believes were founded upon a flawed investigation. He discovered that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to at least eight other fires at business premises and insurance claims dating back to 1967. His findings have been published in Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire, which is being serialised in The Guardian. It stops short of a direct accusation of arson but inferences are clear and he is certain more should have been done at the time to investigate the disaster and those responsible. He hopes these questions can be officially addressed and that his research will prompt a new investigation into the disaster as the 30th anniversary approaches next month. No-one has sought accountability for the fire since the official inquiry chaired by High Court judge Oliver Popplewell recorded its findings following five days of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. The inquiry found that a small fire was probably caused by a spark from a discarded cigarette or match dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. It was the final game of the season and should have been a day of celebration. Before kick-off Bradford were presented before with the trophy for winning the Third Division title. The fire was noticed towards the end of the first half and within four minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. There were no fire extinguishers and no designated fire escapes. A 12-year-old Martin Fletcher is comforted by his mother Susan in 1985 after the Bradford Fire disaster .

Prime minister Margaret Thatcher visits the scene of the disaster with her husband Dennis in 1985 . Tributes paid to the 56 who were killed by the fire on the same day Bradford should have been celebrating . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. The tragedy, followed by Heysel, less than three weeks later, and Hillsborough in 1989, accelerated safety changes in football ground. The community turned inwards to comfort each other. They raised money for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary and supported friends through the aftermath of loss, physical pain and the psychological problems. They were not inspired by the need to fight and clear their names like the families of those killed at Hillsborough. As a whole they accepted it was a terrible accident and nothing came from the media or the courts to change that view. Bradford City reacted to early criticism that it had failed to honour the tragedy and there are memorials in the city centre and at the stadium and an annual memorial service, attended mostly by a few hundred of the people most closely affected. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. Times have changed and social media has fuelled a craving for public outpourings of sympathy. Football's authorities decided that this year there would be a minute's silence before all games on April 25, when Bradford play Barnsley at Valley Parade. It is the final game of the season and Bradford always remember the victims of the fire at the home game closest to the anniversary. Representatives from Bradford and Lincoln have also been invited to Wembley for the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend and the FA will be represented at the annual memorial service in Bradford on May 11. These are specific to the 30th anniversary and yet are in tune with a general increase in attention which has coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes. But it sits uneasily with many at Valley Parade. Then-Bradford chairman  Heginbotham (left) outside Valley Parade, where 56 people died and 265 were injured . The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . Investigators look around the burned out stand at Bradford's ground following the tragedy in 1985 . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Many supporters were unsure about a memorial flag which was taken to Wembley when Bradford reached the League Cup final two years ago. Arsenal and Hull fans then applauded in the 56th minute of last year's FA Cup final, a well-intentioned mark of solidarity copied by Oldham fans at Valley Parade, this season. Others have turned up and started to sing 'Stand up for the 56'. Again, this has provoked a mixed response. Some Bradford supporters believe the victims should be remembered in this way, others prefer it to keep it private. A stage documentary called The 56 is touring local theatres and children's entertainers the Chuckle Brothers have launched a charity single with members of Black Lace. Another fan has been selling old seats numbered 1-56 which were reclaimed from the stand this year while '56' branded hoodies and T-shirts are on sale, some more tasteful than others. Profits from some of these ventures will go to the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit (PSBRU) at the University of Bradford, set up by Professor David Sharpe after the fire. In another year of success for Bradford City, with FA Cup wins against Chelsea and Sunderland, the club has found the dynamic is altering around what was once called football's less remembered tragedy. It may never be the same again after Martin Fletcher's book. He started his own investigations in 1994, when his mother told him Valley Parade had not been Heginbotham's first fire. The more he unearthed, the more his mind was made up. His findings will disturb the peace in Bradford.",

    "input": "The party-loving girlfriend of footballer Johnny Manziel has come under fire on social media for refusing to give up on going out and enjoying herself now her boyfriend is out of rehab. Manziel and Colleen Crowley were spotted together in public for the first time since he entered rehab when they attended Tuesday night's Texas Rangers game. The pair appear to remain very much an item, but Crowley has been taking heat on Instagram for refusing to give up her wild ways while Manziel was being treated for his unspecified problems. Scroll down for video . Johnny Manziel was spotted at a Texas Rangers game Tuesday night days after leaving rehab . On Tuesday, Crowley posted a video on her Instagram page of the Texan socialite enjoying a drunken night out with friends . Manziel finally re-emerged on the weekend after checking into a  facility on January 28 stating that he wanted to 'be a better family member, friend and teammates.' On Tuesday, Crowley - who has amassed more than 130,000 followers since becoming Johnny Football’s girlfriend - posted a video on her Instagram page of the Texan socialite enjoying a drunken night out with friends. The video seemed to enrage a number of followers who voiced their unhappiness that the undergrad at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas may not be setting the best example to someone straight out of rehab. 'F*** you for putting this up after the money man (Manziel) got out of rehab,' commented one follower. Another concerned commenter added some words of warning. 'Significant others are the #1 reason that people fail outside rehab. If you are in rehab, then you have an addictive personality and the drug councilors will atest that one addiction is as good as another for triggering an addict into relapsing.' Crowley has been taking heat on Instagram for refusing to give up her wild ways while Manziel was being treated for his unspecified problems . The party-loving girlfriend of footballer Johnny Manziel has come under fire on social media for refusing to give up on going out and enjoying herself now her boyfriend is out of rehab . Some other commenters on Crowley’s Instagram page are more forgiving. 'It's your life, keep doin you and forget the haters,' writers one supporter. The Cleveland Browns quarterback stayed away from the booze on Tuesday night and was seen sipping nothing stronger than water throughout the game. Manziel's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last July, with some worried his drinking was a priority . According to ESPN, Manziel was 'doing great' in rehab, and had the full support of his team. Now comes the real test as offseason workouts with the team will begin next Monday, April 20. Manziel will be forced to compete with Josh McCown for the starting quarterback position, who just signed a $14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons. Manziel was joined by his girlfriend Colleen Crowley and sipped water throughout Tuesday night . This after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts. Manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the Cleveland Browns season last December, but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem. Especially after one incident last year when, after partying until well past midnight, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns. Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It’s about being accountable... instead of looking like a jackass.' And while his season may have been over at that time, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy. The athlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released on Saturday . It was all the more shocking then when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami over the New Year holiday, alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then he was seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano. At this point, some in the sports world, chief among them columnist Skip Bayless, began to suggest that the Heisman Trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking. Appearing on ESPN’s First Take, Bayless, a noted supporter of Manziel, did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking. 'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless. 'In talking to people in and around the Cleveland Browns, I believe Johnny Manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol. And I believe ... that it is time for Johnny to get some help. Manziel while the 2013 Heisman Trophy as the quarterback of the Texas A&M University Aggies . 'He continues to lie to his executives, to his coaches, to his teammates, to the media, and most of all, he continues to lie to himself.' He then said he would label Manziel an 'alcoholic.' Manziel was known for his partying while at Texas A&M, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland. Just days into his training with the Browns however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field. A source told Cleveland.com at the time; 'Team officials had bought into Manziel's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in College Station, Texas, and they've been stunned by his non-stop antics.'",

    "input": "Havana, Cuba (CNN)Charlie Hill sits in a dark bar on a blindingly sunny Havana day. \"Hey man,\" he says with a smoker's rasp and a nod that indicates he knows you have been looking for him. But then a lot of people have been looking for Charlie Hill for a long time. For 43 years Cuba has provided refuge for Hill from facing charges that he killed a New Mexico police officer and hijacked an airliner to Havana. Hill, now 65, decided to give CNN an interview after we'd spent two years trying to reach him. He wants to discuss how for the first time he is considering leaving his safe haven and returning to the United States. Before talking more, Hill finishes his plastic glass of beer and takes a final draw on his stub of a cigarette. We step out into the sunlight and go to a park where Hill starts to give his reasons why he may soon end his long run from the law. \"I miss my country,\" he said, his voice cracking. \"I miss my family. I would like to go back and see where my grandparents were born, where I was born, where I went to junior high. Eat some blackberry pie. Even go to McDonald's. That's only natural.\" Hill was a black power militant and said he is still a revolutionary. But he craves the kind of French fries that only capitalism can make. After five decades of Cold War-era mistrust, the United States and Cuba are working to re-establish full diplomatic ties, but cases like Hill's present an obstacle to an improved relationship. New Mexico, where Hill's case has been open for decades, followed up on the shift in policy from the Obama administration with Gov. Susana Martinez asking Washington to pursue Hill's extradition. Critics of the new opening to Cuba say Havana's harboring of fugitives like Charlie Hill is enough of a reason to maintain a hard line against the government of Raul Castro and keep Cuba on the State Department list of countries that support terrorism. State Dept. recommends removing Cuba from terrorism list . Hill, now 65, may extradite himself first, saying the warming of relations between the United States and Cuba could mean an end to what he calls his \"exile\" on the communist-run, Caribbean island, even if his return brings jail time. New Mexico Police Chief Pete Kassetas said he welcomed the news of Hill's possible surrender. \"I understand that the social environment was very different in 1971 than it is today. I encourage him to return to face the charges against him on the state level and on the federal level and end his self-imposed exile in Cuba.\" Charlie Hill's  journey began on November 8, 1971, when he and two other men -- Michael Finney and Ralph Goodwin --  were pulled over on I-40 outside Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the middle of a cross-country drive. All three men were members of the Republic of New Afrika, a black power militant group that sought to break off Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina into a separate nation for African-Americans. They were on the way from California to the South with a car loaded with weapons to support the cause. New Mexico State Police Officer Robert Rosenbloom pulled over their rented Ford Galaxie sedan, on suspicion that the car was stolen, said Kassetas. At 10:41 p.m., Rosenbloom called in the California license plate of the militants' car, according to the New Mexico Law Enforcement Memorial. Fourteen minutes later the dispatcher radioed Rosenbloom back but was unable to reach him. A police officer arriving at the scene found Rosenbloom's body lying face down on the road, Kassetas said. There was a single bullet wound to his throat. Rosenbloom gripped his flashlight with one hand and his gun with the other, according to the records of the New Mexico Law Enforcement Memorial. The sedan was found the next day abandoned with three military rifles, a 12-gauge shotgun, \"revolutionary literature,\" bomb-making materials and hundreds of rounds of ammunition . Hill copped to riding in the sedan that Rosenbloom pulled over but refused to say who shot the policeman. \"I am not a cop killer. I am a freedom fighter,\" Hill said. \"I am a Vietnam vet and people never ask me if I killed Vietnamese because that was authorized by the American government. I dedicated myself to liberating my people.\" For 19 days, Hill said, the men hid out in the New Mexico desert, working on an escape plan as 250 law enforcement officers closed in. \"We had to go into exile so we hijacked a plane,\" Hill said. The three men, Kassetas said, commandeered a tow truck at gunpoint, crashed through a fence onto the runway of Albuquerque International Airport and ran up the gangway to TWA Flight 106. Elizabeth Walthall was a flight attendant aboard the Boeing 727 when the fugitives stormed aboard. \"They were dirty and stunk from hiding out in the hills,\" she told CNN from her home in North Carolina. Walthall, now 72, said Charlie Hill put a blade to her throat. \"He told me to do what he said because 'this is no butter knife.' I told him, 'Well, I am no piece of bread.'\" Hill laughed, she said, and lowered the knife. Hijacker Michael Finney glowered and pointed a pistol at the flight attendants, Walthall said, a tremor of fear audible in her voice, as if the hijacking had just happened. \"Finney said he would shoot us and that he had already killed a man,\" Walthall said. The hijackers ordered the crew to fly to Africa. Informed the plane couldn't fly that far, they changed their destination. Take us to Cuba, they told the pilot. The trio knew Cuba would most likely let them stay. After seizing power in 1959, Fidel Castro blasted Washington for failing to send back the Batista regime officials who streamed to Miami to escape Castro's revolutionary tribunals, effectively ending the extradition agreement between the two countries. A rash of airplane hijackings to the island soon followed. Cuba became popular with leftist revolutionaries as well as common criminals seeking a country beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. \"If anything went down, you went to Cuba,\" Hill said. En route to Havana, flight attendant Walthall said she served the men bottles of Michelob beer. When they finished, she saved the bottles in airsickness bags so U.S. law enforcement later would have their fingerprints. After landing, Walthall said she last saw Charlie Hill and the other hijackers as Cuban soldiers escorted them off the plane. Years later, the flight attendant said she experienced flashbacks of the hijacking and sometimes prayed for Hill. \"I think he is a lost soul,\" she said. Revolutionary Cuba soon disappointed Hill.  Cuban officials denied his request for military training to fight with revolutionary groups in Africa. Instead he was put to work cutting sugar cane, doing construction and administrating a clothing store. One of the many menial jobs he worked, he said, put him under the supervision of Ramón Castro, Fidel Castro's older brother. \"He has a big beard and looks just like Fidel,\" Hill remembered. \"He was good to us, made sure we were always well fed.\" In 1996, then-New Mexico Rep. Bill Richardson traveled to Cuba to discuss Hill's extradition with Fidel Castro. \"I talked to Fidel and he said, 'No way, under no circumstances would he turn them over, that they were legitimate fugitives,\" Richardson told CNN. \"I got a very strong signal not only would I not be allowed to bring back Charlie Hill but I wouldn't even be allowed to talk to him.\" Hill is now the last living member of the trio of hijackers. U.S. officials said that Ralph Goodwin drowned in 1973 and Michael Finney succumbed to throat cancer in 2005. Married and divorced twice in Cuba, Hill has two children on the island and he worries about leaving them if he were to return to the United States. But Hill said he wants to visit his daughter, who was 6 years old when he left, and who he hasn't seen since. He dreams of meeting the five grandchildren he has in United States. He's gone as far as hiring a New Mexico attorney, in case he decides to negotiate a surrender. His Cuban government pension is a meager $10 a month, he said. Not nearly enough to support him or even buy toys for his 8-year-old Cuban son. Hill said he became a babalao, or Santeria priest, but still hasn't found peace. He admitted he smokes too many unfiltered Cuban cigarettes and drinks too much cheap rum. And there's always the possibility that the Cuban government has held onto Hill and other U.S. fugitives, simply waiting for the right moment to trade them to the United States. He said he is fine with that fate. \"They took me in,\" he said. \"If the Cuban government feels me going is for the benefit of 12 million people, that's my sacrifice. I don't worry about that.\" As the interview ends, Hill lights another cigarette. A group of Americans touring Havana in a 1950's classic car pull up to the park. They have no idea they are feet away from a wanted fugitive, but as Hill would say, that's Cuba. Hill isn't interested in staying in touch. He doesn't have a cell phone. Too poor, he says. He won't say exactly where he lives in Havana. He has to be cautious. And as he walks off, once again, he is gone. A side of Cuba not often seen .",

    "input": "Celtic are considering a second double raid on Dundee United for teenager John Souttar and striker Nadir Ciftci. The Tannadice club sparked a row with supporters when they sold star duo Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to the Parkhead club on deadline day in January. Jackie McNamara’s side have won just three of their 14 games since, and lost 3-0 at home to Ronny Deila’s side on Sunday. Dundee United midfielder John Souttar (right) challenges for possession with Celtic's Kris Commons . Heavily linked with Ciftci in January, the Norwegian has also earmarked 18-year-old Souttar as potential cover for Scott Brown and Nir Bitton in a holding midfield role. The teenager has recently impressed in the middle of the pitch since switching from central defence. Ciftci and Souttar are under contract until May next year and could go for a combined fee of £1.5million. Admitting there is huge pressure on the Europa League contenders not to sell any more players to Celtic, however, United No 2 Simon Donnelly said: ‘I think that’s always going to be there. All the drama that was whipped up over the stuff in January wasn’t helpful to the club, but we as coaches and the manager just have to try and focus on our job here. You are always going to have interest and speculation. We’ve had to deal with it for the two years we’ve been here.’ Adding to the pressure on United was the public release of a clause in manager McNamara’s contract entitling him to a cut of any transfer profits. Celtic are also interested in signing striker Nadir Ciftc from Dundee United . Insisting Tannadice minds are focused on securing a European slot next season, Donnelly played down talk of a move for Ciftci or anyone else, adding: ‘Nadir is a Dundee United player, so it’s our job in the next five games to go and try to reach Europe and Nadir will help us do that.’ Meanwhile, referee Steven McLean will be back in the firing line this weekend for the first time since he and his officials missed a crucial hand-ball by Caley Thistle defender Josh Meekings in Celtic’s Scottish Cup semi final defeat to Inverness at Hampden on April 19. The duo are likely to cost Celtic around £1.5million, the second double raid on the club after signing Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven . Celtic, who had been leading 1-0 at the time, went on to lose 3-2 and subsequently wrote to the SFA demanding an explanation. Meekings was hit with a notice of complaint by SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan, which could have seen him miss the final, but Inverness were successful in contesting the charge. As a result of the fall-out, McLean was spared a top-flight assignment last week, serving as fourth official in Motherwell’s trip to Hamilton, but will be back in the middle on Saturday for the bottom-six clash between Kilmarnock and Accies at Rugby Park.",

It is based in the high-end Ennismore Gardens, London where Gardner, who famously starred in The Killers, The Barefoot Contessa, 55 Days at Peking and The Night of the Iguana, lived from 1968 - after her three failed marriages, to Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra -  until her death in 1990. Homes along Ennismore Gardens have a long history, built in 1870 as part of the redevelopment of Kingston House, a Palladian mansion dating back to the 18th Century, belonging to Elizabeth Chudleigh, Duchess of Kingston. The mansion and its estate was later sold to William Hare, Baron of Ennismore, in 1837, but was sold off for development following his death, with the street and private gardens named to commemorate him. Once completed the five-storey homes along Ennismore Gardens, designed with Porticos and Corinthian Columns, commanded a premium of £17,000 per year. The pin-up girl of her era, Ava Gardner (right) was listed 25th among the American Film Institute's Greatest Female Stars in the 1950s with high-profile marriages to Mickey Rooney and Frank Sinatra (pictured with Ava, left) Gardner, pictured at her Knightsbridge flat in the same building was once quoted as saying 'I love the history and grandeur of my little London retreat, some say it is too big for me alone, but I love the space' Once described as 'the most irresistible woman in Hollywood', Ava Gardner became one of the pin-up girls in the 1950s. High-profile roles in in films such as the Hucksters (1947), Show Boat (1951) and The Night of the Iguana (1964) catapulted her into the limelight. But her off-screen life was often as dramatic as the roles she played, with marriages to Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra. She was said to have been the only woman who could ever tame the notorious playboy Sinatra. After they met he told Ava: ‘All my life, being a singer was the most important thing in the world. Now you’re all I want.’ The pair married in 1951 but it was tumultuous. Ava was a diva with a soul whose turbulence equalled his own. Both ­harboured profound feelings of ­worthlessness, which expressed ­themselves in volcanic furies. ‘We were high-strung people,’ she said. ‘Possessive, jealous and liable to explode fast. When I lose my temper, you can’t find it any place. He’s the same.’ Like him, she was infinitely restless and easily bored. In both, this tendency could lead to casual cruelty to others —and to each other. They quarrelled ­constantly. Friends whose house the lovers met in recalled how Ava would scream at Frank and he would slam the door and storm downstairs. Eventually the couple split in 1957. She later moved to London where she was to pass away on January 25, 1990, at age 67. She is listed 25th among the American Film Institute's Greatest Female Stars.

    "input": "With the coffee drinking scene continuing to grow in Britain, baristas and cafe owners are putting more thought into the cakes and pasties that accompany your beverage. And while coffee matching rules are not as hard and fast as wine pairing ones, there are still some things you should consider. So the next time you order a latte and reach for a slice of cake, you might want to want to rethink your choice of dessert and have a Chelsea bun instead. The next time you order your coffee give some thought to your choice of pastry . The classic English pastry has been identified as the perfect accompaniment to a creamy latte, as well as a cinnamon swirl and a pain au raisin. And espressos are best paired with chocolate truffles or a mini raspberry coulis. Flat whites are best accompanied by a blueberry muffin, and a plain black coffee is best drunk with a glazed ring doughnut. Will Corby, from online coffee subscription company Pact Coffee, told FEMAIL: ‘It is worth remembering that the coffee used to brew different types of coffee will all have different flavour profiles so the acidity/bitterness/sweetness balance of the coffee used is something to consider when pairing it with pudding. From lattes to espresso and Americano to cafe au lait, here are Will's picks for the best puddings and pastries to accompany your cup of java. A latte (left) which has a light espresso flavour is best complemented with a Chelsea bun (right) LATTE: Cinnamon swirl, Chelsea bun or pain au raisin . Something big and hearty has to go with the light texture and sweetness of a latte. Delicate spice and toasted pastry flavours should work best, allowing you to detect the light espresso flavour through the warm milk. ESPRESSO: Chocolate truffle or mini raspberry couli . Espresso is strong and short drink, your taste buds will be exposed to very intense tastes when you drink it and any accompaniment needs to either pack an equally intense punch or complement in an alternative and cleansing way. I would suggest the chocolate truffle be paired with a fruity espresso and the raspberry couli with a more chocolatey espresso. FLAT WHITE: Muffins . A light fluffy muffin (blueberry is my choice of sweet) should accompany your flat white really well but if you are prepared to take things a little further a ham and cheese sweet/savoury muffin works even better! IRISH COFFEE: Cheese and crackers . Definitely an end of meal, post-dessert drink this is best paired with cheese - perhaps a crumbly hard cheese like a Lancashire -  and sweet crackers but maybe avoid the chutney. Glazed ring doughnuts (left) will bring out the flavour profile of a plain black coffee (right) CAPPUCCINO: Amaretti . Amaretti for dipping, avoid any extra milk or other intense flavours when it comes to this drink. BLACK COFFEE: Doughnuts . Black coffee (brewed filter or with a V60 dripper) with tends to have a more delicate flavour profile than coffee brewed in other ways. Drink it with a glazed ring doughnut to make the most of the coffee flavours. AMERICANO: Baked New York cheesecake . A cheesecake and an Americano should sit together really nicely... you will generally end up with a much more developed bitterness in an Americano and the heavy fat and intense sweetness from this cheesecake should balance that perfectly. MOCHA: Marshmallows . Opt for good quality squidgy vanilla marshmallows as this drink already has all the flavour going on. It just needs the addition of a little extra sweetness and texture from the desert. Good quality marshmallows (left) will complement the strong flavours of a mocha (right) CAFE AU LAIT: Croissant . A French classic, this should really be accompanied by croissant and blackcurrant jam. CORTADO: Custard tart . An espresso cut with a small amount of milk, this coffee is Spanish or Portuguese in origin, so I would lean towards a Portuguese (custard) tart for this. MACCHIATO: Almond brittle . To go with this espresso topped with foamy milk, choose almond brittle, which has short, intense caramelised sweetness but tastes more like toffee than sugar. AFFOGATO: Best by itself . This coffee is the dessert, in which an espresso is poured over ice cream so it should require no addition! A post-dessert drink, Irish coffee (left) is best paired with a crumbly, hard cheese such as  Lancashire (right) Latte: Coffee made with espresso and steamed milk. Espresso: Strong coffee made by forcing steam through ground coffee beans. Flat white: An Australian invention this is prepared by pouring microfoam (steamed milk with fine bubbles) over a single or double espresso. Irish coffee: Coffee made with Irish whisky and sugar, and topped with cream. Cappucino - Smaller in volume than a latte, a cappucino has hot milk and steamed milk foam with one shot of expresso. Affogato: Vanilla ice-cream topped with a hot shot of espresso. Americano: Espresso diluted with hot water. Mocha: A chocolate flavoured latte with espresso and hot milk. Cafe au lait: A light brown coffee with milk. Macchiato: Espresso with a small amount of steamed, foamed milk. Cortado: A Spanish version of the macchiato made with espresso and a small amount of steamed milk.",
    "output": "Head of Coffee at Pact Coffee Will Corby recommends the best pairings .\nHave a crumbly, hard cheese like Lancashire with your Irish coffee .\nA delicately spiced pastry will let you detect light espresso flavour in latte ."

    "input": "Sit down for a moment. Relax. Then clasp your hands together so your fingers entwine — don’t overthink it! Now look at your thumbs. Which one is on top — the left one or the right? If you are a man, the odds are it will be the left; if you are a woman, it is more likely to be the right. Now unfold your hands and take a look at your fingers, in particular your index finger (next to your thumb) and your ring finger (next to your little finger). It can be quite subtle, but in men the ring finger (measured from the crease where it joins the hand) is likely to be longer than the index finger. In women the two fingers are typically the same length. Scroll down for video . Strangely enough, your hands give clues to what is sometimes called ‘brain sex’ — the way your brain reflects your gender. Of course, we all have different skills and interests, but some are considered more typically male, and occur more commonly in men, while others are described as more typically female, and occur more commonly in women. According to popular mythology, men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts. You find men in pubs discussing the top speed of a car they are never going to drive, let alone own. They cling to the TV remote control. They like spending time in sheds. Women, on the other hand, are said to be better at empathy and understanding what another person is feeling or needs. In an emotional crisis, they are more likely to offer sympathy. If you are a man you may be surprised to learn that there are more than 400 different human emotions. If you’re a woman you probably knew that already. This is the stuff of jokes and self-help books — but it is also shown to be true through science. The question is, do these tendencies result from nature — with the biological gender we are born with deciding our interests and personalities — or do they result from nurture, with society and upbringing creating the differing ways that men and women behave? In the SBS One series Horizon Professor Alice Roberts and Dr Michael Mosley examine the links between gender and the brain . The SBS One series Horizon asked Professor Alice Roberts and me to investigate. We started from very different positions. Alice thinks apparent brain differences between the sexes have been exaggerated by how our culture treats boys and girls. In the programme she carries out fascinating tests to prove her point, such as dressing up little boys as girls and vice versa and watching how people treat them. Almost immediately, the girls start rough-housing and playing with trucks, while the boys are treated far more gently by the adults around them. She argues that parents’ unconscious actions — such as being gentler with girls and letting boys behave more roughly — often mould children into men and women who embody gender stereotypes. While I agree that lots of wild generalisations about men and women are bandied around, I also think there may be something in claims that our fundamental biology influences how we behave. Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, an expert on the brain who I visited at Cambridge University, has done a lot of pioneering work on this. He believes, broadly, that people of whatever gender fall somewhere along a ‘systemiser’ to ‘empathiser’ spectrum. Systemisters: According to popular mythology, men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts, like these young train spotters pictured at Chislehurst and Sidcup station . Systemisters are people who enjoy breaking down and analysing systems. They are more likely to become train spotters or computer scientists. They are what he has called ‘male brained’ — as these qualities occur most frequently, but far from exclusively, in men. Empathisers, on the other hand, are more typically ‘female’ brained as they are more typically women. Although there are exceptions, most men — when tested — come out as more ‘systemising’ than ‘empathising’, while for women it is the other way round. While Professor Baron-Cohen accepts social pressures are important in influencing choices and behaviour, his studies suggest the hormones babies are exposed to in the womb can also shape the brain. Higher levels of testosterone in utero, for example — as measured in long-term studies that took samples from pregnant women then followed their children from birth — are associated with offspring who are less empathetic but better at some mental skills later in life. In other words, more testosterone during pregnancy produces babies with a more male brain (we’re not yet sure why some mothers produce more testosterone). Dr Mosley will examine if habits, characteristics and preferences are a result of 'nature or nurture' Empathisers, on the other hand, are more typically ‘female’ brained as they are more typically women . An indirect way of assessing how much testosterone you were exposed to is by looking at your fingers. A number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger, the more ‘male’ your brain is likely to be. Mine is slightly more ‘male’ than average but much less so than, say, a professional footballer, who is typically male brained with great spatial awareness skills. As you can imagine, this is a controversial area of science. Professor Baron-Cohen does these studies because he is interested in autism, which he describes as an extreme version of the male brain — more interested in systems and often struggling with empathy. When he started his research there was a lot of criticism, based partly on the fear studies like his will be used to support unhelpful stereotypes — suggesting men can’t excel in female areas and vice versa. Ignoring gender differences, however, comes with its own dangers. Take the problem of pain. A while ago, when I was making a programme called Pleasure And Pain, we did a survey where we asked people which of the sexes they thought was better at tolerating pain — 81 per cent of women said ‘women’, while a mere 11 per cent thought men were the tougher breed. A number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger, the more ‘male’ your brain is likely to be . Although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt, the majority, 54 per cent, still agreed ‘women’ were more stoical. But is this right? One way to find out is to get male and female volunteers to take part in a cold water immersion test. This is a standard pain test widely used because it causes acute pain without doing any long-term damage (as long as you don’t do it for more than 15 minutes). In this test, you put your hand in a bucket of ice-cold water and see how long you can keep it there before the pain becomes intolerable. I’ve done it a couple of times and oddly enough after the initial shock it doesn’t actually feel cold; below about 3 degrees Celsius your pain receptors overwhelm your temperature receptors so you are no longer able to tell if the water is hot or freezing. All you know is that it is incredibly painful. When this test is done in a laboratory setting, men almost always outlast women. This may be pure machismo, but Professor Jeff Mogil of McGill University, Montreal, thinks there is more to it. As he puts it: ‘There are all kinds of reasons to believe there are different neural systems in the brain of males and females.’ That is, our brains process pain differently because our brains are different: our varying ability to withstand pain is proof. He thinks it is unfortunate that much basic pain research has, until recently, been done in male animals. Although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt, the majority, 54 per cent, still agreed ‘women’ were more stoical . Males don’t menstruate or go on heat, which makes them simpler and cheaper to study. But it also means we have been developing and testing drugs on males, assuming that they will work just as well on females, which may not be the case. We’ve come to realise, for example, paracetamol works better on men, while some opioids work better on women. We don’t, however, know why. That situation is now changing as researchers involve more females and start actively looking for differences. Indeed, Jeff imagines a future where pharmaceutical companies produce pain-killing drugs that are specific to one gender. So perhaps we’ll have pink painkillers for women, and blue ones for boys, each honed to work on the specific male or female brain. ‘If that happens,’ says Jeff, ‘that’ll be a first in medicine.’ It may also mean far more effective medication for all of us. Head injury, a leading cause of death and disability in young people, is another area where studying gender differences could bring significant benefits. Is your brain male or female? Documentary premieres on SBS One on Monday at 7.30pm . A couple of years ago, I was in a large military hospital in Afghanistan, filming a series called Frontline Medicine for the BBC. I saw a number of soldiers, male and female, with serious head injuries. I was told that the women were likely to make a better recovery than the men. Why? It may be, in part, because women have higher levels of progesterone. Progesterone is best known as a female hormone, involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, but it is also important for the development of neurones — the cells that carry messages in the brain. Animal studies and a few small human trials have shown that giving progesterone soon after suffering a brain injury improves survival and recovery. Larger studies, some of them funded by the military, are currently underway. This, I think, is why researching gender differences is worth doing. It is not because it will help us understand why men struggle to remember their children’s birthdays or why there are fewer female darts players, but because it may help us find more effective ways to tackle disease.

Cult US sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother will be taken off air for 12 hours – with viewers tuning in on 7 May shown instead an advert telling people to go to the polls. The specially-produced advert will be played, featuring 'Darren' – the man fictionally in charge of keeping E4 on air, sitting in the channel's control room. Scroll down for video . A specially-produced advert will be played on E4 on May 7 featuring 'Darren' – the man fictionally in charge of keeping the programme on air . The radical move could have a significant impact on the election with the advert set to be seen by millions of potential voters. E4 is the most popular channel for younger viewers, reaching 8.7 million 16-34 year olds every month – ahead of BBC2 and Channel 5. Its regular schedule will be suspended from 7am, when polls open, to 7pm, three hours before polling closes, when the channel will return to normal with Hollyoaks. Dan Brooke, Channel 4's chief marketing officer said: 'Less than half of under-25s voted at the last election so we've engaged the most powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number - switching off their favourite TV channel for the day.' E4's sister station Channel 4 will also run a special advertising campaign encouraging youngsters to vote. Voters aged between 18-24 and 25-34 are by far the least likely to take part in elections, prompting fears that politicians have given up trying to appeal to their concerns . The adverts will ask viewers: 'How many times have you missed life-changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show? 'May 7 is election day and Darren is going to turn E4 off so you might as well go and vote. You won't forget will you Darren?' But viewers will only be able to take advantage of the TV switch-off if they have already registered to vote – with the deadline having already passed. Meanwhile, Channel 4 will present an 'alternative' to the election night coverage on the BBC and ITV, with a programme co-anchored by Jeremy Paxman and comedian David Mitchell. Paxman, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last June, said: 'Elections matter. But that doesn't mean the coverage has to be dull. I hope there'll be room for both insight and laughter.' The election-day shut down on E4 will see programmes including 'How I Met Your Mother' (pictured) taken off air for 12 hours . Fans of the US sitcom The Big Bang Theory will also be hit by the E4 decision to switch off its coverage between 7am and 7pm . Mitchell added: 'Our aim is to keep people watching much later than they intended and we will be judged by the dip in the nation's productivity on Friday 8 May.' The show will also include special election-themed episodes of Gogglebox and The Last Leg. The BBC's coverage of the election will be anchored by David Dimbleby, while Tom Bradby presides over ITV's election show and Adam Boulton anchors Sky's coverage.",

He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet: \"This one was on film.\" Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. \"Stopped by the cops again wish me luck,\" he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it \"driving while black.\" Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. And in amid increased conversation over race and policing after the high-profile deaths last year of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the issue is even more sensitive. Rock hasn't commented on the tweets and didn't say how the police stop turned out. He got lots of support on Twitter. \"My heart legit dropped, no kidding,\" one Twitter fan posted. Many praised him for documenting the stops. Some accused him of race-baiting. But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to \"#Adapt\" to avoid racial profiling. \"I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police,\" Washington tweeted. Some saw that as a sell-out, saying Rock shouldn't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over. \"Let me guess..you also make sure your pants are pulled up as well?.\" Twitter user YeshaCallahan posted. Appearing on CNN, Washington defended the tweet, saying he wanted to \"excite a conversation.\" Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his \"Chris Rock\" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" with Jerry Seinfeld. The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini. And what happened? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas. \"Here's the crazy thing,\" Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo. \"If you weren't here, I'd be scared.\"",

    "input": "Father-of-two: Paul Doyle, 56, has been jailed after being unmasked as the head of drugs ring . A gangster who lived a life of luxury in a mansion near Premier League footballers has been jailed for 16 years after being unmasked as the head of a drugs ring. Father-of-two Paul Doyle, 56, moved his family into an £820,000 home in Altrincham, Cheshire, despite having never worked and living life ‘on tick’ and incapacity handouts. Doyle - described as a ‘well-known and colourful character’ in his native Salford - put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive. But his family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood in Altrincham where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children who complained of being robbed and beaten up. Police kept watch on the family’s home where Doyle chopped down the huge front hedge so he could check for unwanted visitors outside. He was eventually arrested during a raid on his five-bedroom house after a major investigation into the supply of various drugs in the North of England, which culminated in the seizure of £15million of cocaine and a haul of heroin. The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford. Doyle admitted supplying class A and B drugs, between 2012 and 2014, plus money laundering and benefit fraud offences at Manchester Crown Court. He now faces a proceeds of crime hearing. Going in: Police are seen raiding Doyle's £820,000 five-bedroom home in Altrincham, Cheshire, in July 2014 . Luxurious life: Doyle put down a £200,000 deposit and obtained a £600,000 mortgage on the property (above) by falsely claiming his wife Jeanette, 49, worked as a company executive . The court heard Doyle had bought the house as his ‘dream family home’ in 2004 after being freed from a seven-year jail term for cocaine and cannabis dealing plus assault. He was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work. But he fraudulently claimed Mrs Doyle earned £197,000 a year as a ‘project executive’ for a lettings firm and she was given a mortgage of £616,000. Monthly mortgage repayments were about £3,000 but the accounts were consistently in arrears. And in June 2006 Doyle took out loans totalling £83,000 with finance companies by making similar false representations about Mrs Doyle’s income - and even acquired a new BMW vehicle. Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012. On average monthly deposits of £5,778 were made totalling around £77,000 per year. Police began secretly filming Doyle and started to track his car. It emerged he helped finance a cocaine deal in which drugs were brought into the country by couriers who travelled to the UK from France on fishing boats. Entering: The family have since lost the property and Mrs Doyle is now living in a council house in Salford . Going in: Doyle's family were probed after scandalising the leafy neighbourhood where his teenage son regularly rode quad bikes around the streets and later received an Asbo for terrorising other local children . Up to 4.2lbs (1.9kg) of heroin and 170lbs (77kg) of cocaine landed in the UK - but police began arresting Doyle’s accomplices, and he got directly involved in deals himself. He organised a collection of 2.2lbs (1kg) of heroin in Wigan, and then started running a wholesale supply line in cannabis, involving up to 88lbs (40kg), and amphethamines, amounting to around  44lbs (20kg), to crime families in Barrow-in-Furness and Carlisle in Cumbria. He was eventually caught in May last year with 6.6lbs (3kg) of amphetamines in Salford. Whilst in jail on remand police decoded conversations in which Doyle chatted about drugs - one in which he talked about how a friend ‘wanted his hoover back’ - linking him to a Cumbrian heroin dealer who hid just an ounce of the drug inside his Henry vacuum cleaner. Suspicion: Despite the late mortgage payments Doyle paid £450,000 into his and his wife’s bank accounts over a six-year period between 2006 and 2012 . Home: Doyle was claiming tax credits and other handouts, saying two heart attacks made him unable to work . Other recorded conversations heard Doyle use the codeword ‘downstairs’ for heroin, which police were able to work out because of the timing and context of the conversations. Altrincham, a market town near Manchester Airport, is the location of four of the ten most expensive streets in the North West. The top-priced road has an average property value of £2.5million. Manchester City stars James Milner and Joe Hart live in the Altrincham area, in homes worth £3.3million and £2.9million respectively, and Ireland assistant boss Roy Keane is said to have a house there. The local residents also include ex-England international Emily Heskey, who now plays for Bolton Wanderers in the Championship and lives in a £3million six-bedroom house with his wife Chantelle. The Hale area of Altrincham was reported to be home to at least 33 Premier League footballers as of 2010 - including Liverpool, Everton and Manchester United players. Ian McMeekin, defending, said the case was the ‘decline and fall of a drug dealer’. He said Doyle once had a building supply business and when buildings were demolished he would broker on the stolen brick. He added: ‘He is a well known local, born and raised in Salford. He is well known as a colourful character.’ He added that he also undertook protection work in West Africa and China where he was working legitimately but while not paying income tax. He said he was also provided with income from dog breeding. Mr McMeekin said: ‘He didn’t involve his wife through pressure or influence. He operated alone and in ignorance. His wife’s salary was ridiculously high, ought to make anyone question the legitimacy of the application. ‘The defendant has nothing left apart from his family - the house has gone. His ruin is complete and he must accept the whole responsibility for it.’ Sentencing, Judge Richard Mansell QC told Doyle he had ‘barefaced gall’ to claim benefits and added: ‘I’m quite satisfied that you played a lead role in all of your offences. ‘You had close links to the original sources of the drugs and you directed and organised the sale of drugs on a commercial scale. You plainly did make a lot of money from these enterprises - where it has gone is another matter.’ He described Doyle as ‘the head of an organised criminal gang’, who continued to orchestrate the business from behind bars because he had ‘loyal servants working on the outside’.",

    "input": "Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta . McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club . At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy . McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round . To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore.

An architect who was wooing 35 woman online was cleared today of raping a blind date hours after they met. Adam Leheup, 34, had denied forcing himself on the 25-year-old telling the jury the woman 'freaked out' when he tried to comfort her about her saggy breasts. During the week long trial the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Leheup ignored her cries of 'no' and afterwards said: 'In my experience girls say no, but they don't mean it'. But following their deliberations a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court found the University of Greenwich graduate, a technical co-ordinator on the £500million Nine Elms Point Development not guilty of rape and sexual assault. The self-confessed first date addict had spent nearly a year on police bail before eventually being charged and appeared emotional, emitting a slight gasp, as he was cleared. Leheup told the jury they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. ‘I noticed she had unusually saggy breasts, she seemed uncomfortable about that,' he told the jury. 'I tried to comfort her by kissing and touching them, then she freaked out.’ He had fought back tears as he told jurors he never had sex with the young woman and didn't do anything she did not consent to. Leheup of Hersham, Surrey, revealed he was communicating with thirty-five woman at the time and regularly having sex with six of them, but stopped short with the complainant. 'She said: 'Stop' once and I turned to my side and started to go to sleep,' he told the jury. 'When girls have said nothing is going to happen, I've ended up having sex with them,' he added. The pair had met her just hours earlier on  July 9, 2013, after the pair chatted on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Leheup ended up returning to the woman's flat in the early hours of the morning after he missed his last train home. 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked,' the complainant told police, the court had heard. 'He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: 'No' a lot, but he was not listening. Leheup appeared emotional after he was cleared of the charges following a week long trial at Blackfriars Crown Court . 'I was saying: 'No', but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: 'Girl's say: 'No', but they don't mean it.' I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Parkour and free-running fan, Leheup was arrested after he left the woman's flat. When questioned by police the architect said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. Leheup walked free from court after the jury returned the not guilty verdicts.",

Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, has been arrested for felony murder and his brother Jean, 17, was shot dead after an incident in which the two reportedly tried to rob a group of Miami drug dealers. Their mother is Roxanne Dubé, who was only recently appointed to the role of consul general in Miami. Scroll down for video . Jean Wabafiyebazu (left) was killed and his brother Marc (right) has been arrested after a gunfight erupted during a drug deal on Monday . Their mother is Roxanne Dubé (above), the recently appointed Canadian Consul General in Miami . According to the Miami Herald, police believe the two young men were armed with guns as they tried to rob a group of men during a drug deal at a home in the Coral Way area. The boys had reportedly agreed to purchase two pounds of marijuana at a cost of $5,000, and driven to the house under the guise of making said purchase in their mother's BMW with diplomatic plates. Police claim that their plan was to then rob the drug dealers. Gunfire broke out soon after they entered, and Jean and Joshua Wright were killed, while Anthony Rodriguez was wounded. Marc was in the car when this incident occurred. Both Marc and Rodriguez were arrested under a Florida law that says anyone who participates in a violent felony that results in death can be charged with murder. Rodriguez has also been charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell. A second man was reportedly with Jean when he went to rob the drug dealers, though his identity is not known at this time. Anthony Rodriguez (above) was arrested on charges of felony murder and drug possession . The boys had driven to a house (above) with a third friend to reportedly purchase two pounds of marijuana for $5,000 . Gunfire erupted soon after they entered, though Marc was in the car at the time . Dubé was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. The boys’ father, Germano Wabafiyebazu, told Global News that he does not think Marc had anything to do with this tragedy, and that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life. 'My wife told me they didn’t go out,' he said. 'They went to school, went home, went to school.'

    "input": "(CNN)Hillary Clinton finally answered the question we've all been asking for years: Will she run for president in 2016? With official news of her candidacy just hours old, one thing is already crystal clear: For the next year and a half, Clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the United States. Win or lose, this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder. Just consider the two potential outcomes. A win would mean a woman in the White House, which is a vital step in the march toward women's full political inclusion. But it's possible that the march will end right there. We'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we've come. We'll raise the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner over the women's movement. And we'll call it a day. Granted, 80% of elected officials throughout the country will still be men. Women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office. And pay inequities, sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve, no matter how hard Clinton might try. \"But we've elected a woman as president,\" we'll say. Let her take care of it. A loss would be even more difficult. Clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is. More generally, her loss would perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections, that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination, and that women must be twice as good to get half as far. \"If Hillary Clinton can't win an election,\" potential female candidates will ask, \"How can I?\" Extrapolating from one female candidate's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect. But in the case of Clinton, it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons. First, Clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate, if there is such a thing. She began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve, and she is even more well-known today. But that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well-publicized baggage. Voters, donors, journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of Clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in Iowa, steps onto a debate stage in New Hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in Kentucky. Too often, we treat Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power. In reality, what people knew about Hillary Clinton likely shaped their views of Hillary Clinton. Widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not. After all, for decades, women who have run for office have performed just as well as men. They win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money. Do some voters still question women's suitability as leaders? Of course they do. But these attitudes, which have become increasingly rare, do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates. Second, presidential politics is, first and foremost, a partisan affair. The D or R in front of the candidates' names -- not the X or Y chromosomes in their DNA -- tells us about how more than 90% of the population will vote. Party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case. Now, I'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week, we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits, and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes, photos and captions that have taken hold on social media. The Clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address, which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes. I don't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate, disrespectful and appalling. And incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates won't need to consider. But men yelling \"Iron my shirt\" at a campaign rally, cable news pundits associating Clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing Hillary Clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections, partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know. If Clinton wins the race, it will be because it was a good year for Democrats. And if she loses, it will be because the GOP developed a winning message. But how much does any of this really matter? Sure, voters are amenable to electing women. Any Democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape. The problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the White House. And inferring too much from Hillary Clinton's experiences is a risky endeavor. Yet the minute Clinton announced her candidacy, she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the United States. That's a label that no female candidate should have to wear. Let the burden begin.",
    "output": "Jennifer Lawless: There's a strong temptation to view Hillary Clinton's candidacy as all about cracking the glass ceiling for women .\nShe says the reality is that most people will vote not on gender but on the economy and partisanship ."

Accident and emergency doctor Lin Xikun knew exactly what he had to do when he walked in on nurse Long Yufang being threatened with a knife by a bare-chested man. The People's Daily Online reported he immediately offered himself up as an alternate hostage - allowing Long to go free. Hostage: The terrifying moment a man walked into a hospital in China and threatened a nurse with a knife was caught on film . The terrifying situation began at about 11am on April 9, when the man walked into the hospital in Dongguan, Guangdong Province. He had been brought in by police the night before. 'He told people that he didn't have any money to get home and not only did he not find anyone willing to give him the money to go home, he injured his leg in the process,' emergency department nurse Huang Chunyan recalled. When he returned the next day, he was carrying a knife. Video footage shows the man wheeling himself to the pharmacy, before he takes the knife out to threaten the nurse. But when he sat down with her, he reassured her: 'Don't worry, I am not going to harm you.' However, he did ask her to call the police and reporters. But Nurse Long - who realised now she would not be harmed - had already screamed out in fear. Hero: Within moments one of the accident and emergency doctors (right) walked in and took her place . Dr Lin heard the scream, and rushed to her aid. Nurse Huang said: 'Dr Lin then told the man \"Look you are scaring the nurse. She is terrified. You just want a hostage right?

His ordeal went on for a further 10 minutes before the local police arrived, and the hostage taker voluntarily put the knife down. Gentleman: Doctor Lun Xikun, pictured in the room later, managed to keep him calm until the police arrived . However, his brave actions have won the doctor a legion of fans.

    "input": "A Sicilian Mafia fugitive dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge who was set to be extradited to Italy will be allowed to remain in the UK after his sentence was dropped. Domenico Rancadore, who has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra. In February he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence. But today it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn. Sentence dropped: Domenico Rancadore (right and left) fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour' Although his conviction remains intact, Italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed. The case will still have to be heard by the Italian Supreme Court, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Rancadore's solicitor, Karen Todner said: 'Yesterday the Italian Court of Appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of Domenico Rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence. 'I am therefore confident that the Italian government will now withdraw their application for a European Arrest Warrant and that Mr Rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings. 'There has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and I am delighted Mr Rancadore will now be able to live in peace in England with his wife and family.' Ms Todner said she was waiting for the CPS to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge Rancadore. Once the paperwork is in order, the matter will be listed at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London and a judge will then have to approve it. The Italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court. Domenico Rancadore, pictured with hiswife Ann last year, will be allowed to remain in the UK after his sentence dropped . Rancadore was first arrested on a European arrest warrant at his semi-detached London home in August 2013. Although he was never convicted of murder, the Italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995. Known as the Professor, Rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his 'Mafia association'. He was convicted for his role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders in Palermo. During protracted extradition proceedings at Westminster Magistrates' Court, District Judge Howard Riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition. In his judgment, Judge Riddle said: 'I am satisfied that, even without the assurance, there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to Italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment.' Before his arrest in 2013, the Mafia don spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge, obscured from view. He claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father, Giuseppe. Rancadore's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 Mafiosi indicted. Before his arrest in 2013, Rancadore spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house in Uxbridge . There was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into Rancadore's case. Extradition expert Edward Grange tweeted: 'What a waste of time and money. After two sets of proceedings, Italy no longer seeks extradition of Rancadore.' Mr Grange, who is vice-chair of the Extradition Lawyers' Association, said: 'The purpose of the extradition request was for Rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment. 'It transpires that as of October last year the Italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence. 'So certainly from October onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the Italian authorities saying: \"Hang on, we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request\". 'Courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition, that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and European arrest warrant scheme. 'It is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying. 'Had the Italians said in October we cannot legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the European arrest warrant, I'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible.' Domenico Rancadore, who has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra . Asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process, Mr Grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic'. Barrister Philip Marshall QC said: 'Yet more incompetence by the CPS in the Rancadore case (allegedly): his seven-year prison sentence expired in October 2014.' There was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of Rancadore's home in Manor Way, Uxbridge, London today. Curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a Mercedes car was parked on the driveway. One neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because 'you never know who will move in'. She went on: 'He seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago.' The neighbour said she last saw Rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health. A court sketch of  Domenico Rancadore. Today it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn . Sharon Walker, who also lives nearby, said: 'They were a normal couple before and I'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple. 'They are very quiet. I would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street. Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere). Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections. The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy. 'He's very quiet. He always has been, even before it all blew up. They are a very quiet family.' Federico Bianchi, head of press at the Italian Embassy, said: 'When, in March 2014, the District Judge denied the extradition of Mr Rancadore to Italy, the Crown Prosecution Service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms, for which they issued a formal excuse. 'That is key to the release of Mr Rancadore because that loss of time, which obliged Italy to start the procedures afresh, issuing a new European Arrest Warrant, because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire. 'It gave the possibility to Mr Rancadore's lawyers, who are clever and know the penal code very well, to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired.' Mr Bianchi also denied that the hearing in February had been 'useless' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in Palermo on March 25. A CPS spokesman said: 'The Italian Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the decision by the Court of Appeal in Palermo is appealable to the Italian Supreme Court. 'It is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today's outcome. 'Until the European arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today, the CPS acted on behalf of the Italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary.' The CPS admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to Rancadore's lawyers on time in March last year. At the time, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders acknowledged that, as a result of the error, it was possible Rancadore would never be extradited to Italy.",

Avoca Beach in the Central Coast, about 95kms north of Sydney, resembled something from a horror film on Tuesday . The entire beach, right up tot he top of the walkways, was covered in a grotesque yellow foam . She added: 'Whenever the wind blew, the foam just felt like you were in a snow globe.' Her videos - which were filmed on Tuesday - show a grotesque, yellow, jelly like substance moving around as the wind blows it up and over surrounding scrubland.

'It's foam that has been swept off the top of the waves because the water was so churned up and its mixed with sand - it's so bizarre,' she said . Ms Freedman and her family were forced to leave the holiday house after their power went out on Tuesday. 'The foam just felt like you were in a snow globe' 'It's hard to say how much was foam and how much had water underneath, but there would have been a good 15 metres or so of that stuff,' Ms Freedman, the co-founder of EndoActive, said. 'It was covering the shrubbery and the whole walk way down to the beach.' Ms Freedman said she and her family were forced to ditch their holiday plans and head back to their Sydney home in Balmain earlier than they'd intended due to the severe storm. 'Avoca doesn't have very much distance between houses and the shore line, so when high tide came up the water was flooding the pathways all down the beach so I was freaking out and thought it would swallow all the houses up,' she said. 'When we went outside we realised it wasn't all water - it was foam.' 'We left yesterday afternoon because all the power went out, there was no electricity, we couldn't use the heaters and the house was freezing, there was no mobile or internet so we couldn't do anything so we just picked a moment in the night and left. 'The wind was just insane. The whole house was howling and it was crazy.' A quick trip to the nearby town of Terrigal, where Ms Freedman and her family tried to find some power, proved fruitless when they found that numerous homes had lost their roofs and the normally flat beach had pounding waves which the Balmain resident described as ‘just mental’. It comes as a second intense low pressure system, centred off the coast of the Hunter region, is predicted to bring heavier rains and more large seas and thunderstorms to large parts of northern Sydney and the Central Coast on Wednesday.

A number of roads had to be closed in the neighbourhood as firefighters worked to remove Georgia Davis, 22, from her specially-adapted flat in Aberdare, south Wales. At the height of the operation yesterday, neighbours said there were 12 fire, police and ambulance vehicles at the property. Scroll down for video . Georgia Davis, 22 (pictured) has been lifted from her home in Aberdare, south Wales, by a crane during a seven-hour emergency operation to take her to hospital . The young woman has previously had to be removed from another property in 2012. At the height of today's operation, neighbours said there were 12 fire, police and ambulance vehicles at the property . French doors at the front of the property were reportedly removed to allow crews to winch the morbidly obese woman out of her home using the crane. It is the second time Ms Davis has had to be rescued in such a way. An eye-witness, who asked not to be named, told the Daily Mirror: 'It's absolute chaos. There's 999 vehicles everywhere and dozens of emergency service workers. 'All the roads are shut down and parents and school transport can't get to the nearby schools and colleges, it's been complete lock down all day.' Retired Margaret Evans, 79, who also lives on the road, said she believed that Ms Davis fell and was unable to get back up again. She told MailOnline: ‘There was loads of traffic here. They had the crane and they shut all the roads. I don’t think they could get her out of the house. ‘They were here for ages, all afternoon. There were police cars in the middle of the road and no one could get in or out. ‘They tried to get her out and they had to take out the French windows eventually. There were so many people crowded watching. ‘Somebody said she fell, if she did I expect she couldn’t get back up again. ‘It’s not very nice, it was quite a disturbance.’ Ms Evans said she had a stint in hospital at the same time as Ms Davis a few years ago. She said: ‘They had to put three hospital beds together for her and she had her own room. ‘Somebody said she’s 50 stone now. I know she was 30 stone in hospital.’ French doors at the front of the property were reportedly removed to allow crews to lift the young woman out using the crane. Today's operation (left and right) took seven hours . An eye-witness, who asked not to be named, said it was 'absolute chaos'. Several roads had to be closed . Neighbour Janice Love described Ms Davis as a ‘lovely’ person and said she always gives her a wave when she passes her house. She said: ‘I’ve spoken to her a lot of times and she’s so nice. I’ve got daughters that age and it’s so sad. ‘We wave into her through the window and sometimes she stands outside with her dog. She always waves back and is more than happy to chat. ‘She has two friends living with her, one I think is her carer. ‘She’s very quiet. I hope she’s going to be alright. She’s such a lovely person.’ Ms Davis, who has suffered with yo-yo dieting for most of her life, also had to be removed from another property on a crane in 2012. During that incident, a 40-strong team of builders, scaffolders and crew from all three emergency services was involved in the complex operation to remove Ms Davis from her home. As well as knocking down walls, the emergency services were forced to build a temporary ramp from the first floor of the house to the pavement to get her out. Local traffic also had to be diverted. The operation to cut into her home, which came after she telephoned her mother to say she couldn't stand up, cost emergency workers an estimated £100,000.

As well as knocking down walls, the emergency services were forced to build a temporary ramp from the first floor of the house to the pavement to get her out. Local traffic also had to be diverted . After that rescue operation, Ms Davis was admitted to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil where she stayed for several months due to suffering organ failure. While there, she dropped down to 40stone. At the time she vowed to lose more weight and get her life back on track, saying: ‘I'm sick of being like this - I'm getting my life back.’ She went on to lose 18st in four months. Ms Davies, who has suffered from bullying for most of her life, originally started to gain weight when she began comfort eating following the death of her father. But in August 2008, a 33st Ms Davies was told by doctors to 'lose 20 stones or die.' Spurred into action, she attended a £3,600-a-month diet academy in the U.S - dubbed 'Fat Camp' - for nine months, during which time she shrank to 18st and beat her Type 2 diabetes. While at the Wellspring Academy in North Carolina, she was seen by behavioural coaches, food psychologists and fitness trainers and encouraged to walk 10,000 steps every day. But, after returning to the UK in June 2009, she discovered her step-father had cancer. She moved back into her parents' home and started putting on weight again. In less than a year, she had piled on another ten stone.

The 5ft 6in woman admitted how she used to order up to 20 kebabs each week from a takeaway and gorge throughout the day on chocolate, crisps and two litre bottles of Coca Cola. Her mother Lesley has also previously spoken of her guilt over the woman's obesity. In an interview, she said she and her daughter had started comfort eating after her husband Geoff died when Ms Davis was five. But she said she had later made a determined effort to change their diets – such as making her own chips instead of buying them from the takeaway. A spokeswoman for Cwm Taf University Health Board said: 'We can confirm that the fire service was brought in earlier today to assist us with access to a property in order to safely transport a patient into hospital. We do not comment on individual patients.'",

    "input": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)We came on a commercial flight to Kathmandu. Blue tarps were visible from the sky for people to hide under -- signs that there was something wrong. We had to circle the airport for a couple of hours. There were a couple of issues. There was an aftershock this afternoon, so they were checking the runway for damage. Military and aid flights have priority, and a few military planes -- Indian military planes -- were going in, trying to bring in aid. Whether they did is unclear. When we landed at the airport, it was wet and cold. A couple of thousand people were lining the road to the entrance to the airport trying to get out. But there's no way to get out, really. There were torrential rainstorms for a couple of hours, and with the strong aftershock a couple of hours ago, no one wants to go inside. The residents of Kathmandu sure don't. You can see some structural damage to buildings. Most buildings are not up to high construction standards. Fallen: Nepal's historic landmarks . Driving through the city, there's not a huge amount of visible damage. There's some damage to houses and buildings, but it's not as visual as the Haiti earthquake (of 2010). We were able to drive the main road to the hotel we're staying at, but they're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks. The guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn. People are squeezed in. There are probably about 100 people in there. The tents are covered, but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water, especially around the edges of the tent. So people are outside in the rain with no shelter. It's visually stark, with people in the streets. It's colder than usual this time of year. I'm cold and damp. When it's almost May, it's usually much hotter. There's very little power in the city -- no power to speak of, no drinking water. For the residents, it's really bad. Very soon, they will need shelter. Temporary shelters have been put up, but very few -- 16 -- by the government. It looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned. People are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings. Those who survived -- and those who didn't . There are issues with fuel in the city, and driving in, all the stores were shuttered. You occasionally see a cart with food or a few bottles of drinking water, but for the most part, nothing is being sold in the city. I don't think they're very concerned about looting, and there's no military in the streets, but they will have to get water and food in the city soon. Communal kitchens have been set up for cooking. Not by the government -- people set them up on their own. People are beside themselves in shock. Their biggest concern now is the structures, needing a place for shelter, to hide from the elements and sleep. Food will become the biggest concern in the coming days. Kathmandu isn't the epicenter though. No one's sure what it's like at the epicenter. People haven't been able to get to outlying areas. We haven't been able to corroborate this, but the people we're talking to here say there's damage to the villages outside Kathmandu -- thousands of houses damaged to the north, closer to the epicenter. CNN's Ingrid Formanek reported from Kathmandu and Mark Morgenstein wrote in Atlanta.",

    "input": "Three generations of one family were saved from their car last week by a police officer seconds before the vehicle was pulled out to sea in Washington State. Peter Reece, his fiancee, baby daughter and mother from Kent were parked on an Ocean Shores beach on Thursday around 7pm in their new Nissan Infiniti when their tires got stuck in the sand. Reece told police that he and his family had been driving on the beach when they stopped on the edge of the surf to look at the water. Peter Reece, his fiancee, mother and six-month-old daughter were parked on an Ocean Shores, Washington, beach on Thursday when the tide came in and trapped the family . The wheels of the car sunk into the wet sand, so they were unable to move. Reece and his fiancee got out of the car, but his mother and daughter were trapped inside . In Ocean Shores there are roads that lead on to beach approaches, where drivers can go from road to beach. Reece and his family parked near the West Chance ala Mer beach approach. Reece said that the tide was 30 feet from where they were parked, but within a few minutes it had already reached so far up that it was hitting their car. The tires sunk into the wet sand and the family was unable to drive away, according to KXRO. 'There were waves coming back to back and crashing against the car like really loud and really hard,' Reece told Komo News. Reece and his fiancee were able to get out of the car, but the grandmother and child were stuck in the car because the wet sand surrounding them was keeping the doors shut. Seconds after Ocean Shores police officer Kyle Watson saved the grandmother and baby, a wave hit the car, flipping it and pulling it out to sea . The car was recovered shortly after the incident and a bulldozer was used to flip it on its right side before it was towed to the road . 'I was just trying to get us out as quickly as possible because I know when the tide gets higher it takes everything with it,' Reece said. Ocean Shores police  arrived on scene, finding Reece in the car with his mother and six-month-old baby, according to KBKW. Officer Kyle Watson had to force the door to the car open because the car had sunken so far into the wet sand. He helped the woman and baby out of the car and led them up the beach. Reece was able to get out on his own. They were only about 20 feet up the beach when another wave hit and lifted the car up into the water, flipping it on to its roof. 'And another wave hit and the car was on its top. So if we stayed in 30 second longer we would have been upside down,' Reece said. After being lifted up by the sea, the car eventually beached and had to be flipped by a bulldozer, before it was taken back to the road by a tow truck. Tow truck driver Christopher Macasieb, who helped get the car out of the sand, said that the car kept rolling on to its side because of the waves. In Ocean Shores there are roads that lead on to beach approaches, where drivers can go from road to beach, which is how the Reece family made their way to the surf . Police officer Paul Henderson said that because of the approaches, beached cars are not an uncommon problem in the city . 'It's unfortunate because it is a brand new car. But cars can be replaced. Lives cant,' he said. The Reece family, too, said they were grateful that all that was lost was the car. Ocean Shores officer Paul Henderson told Daily Mail Online that because there are beach approaches for people to drive on to, having cars get stuck in the sand is a somewhat common issue. 'You're allowed to park and drive on the beach within certain areas. Usually people are more aware of the tides,' Henderson said, adding that the Reece family was close to the surf. He said that some cars have gone out so far into the water that they have to be recovered at a later time. But the Reeces' car was recovered 'a short time later'. The car flipped on the Ocean Shores beach just before 7pm on Thursday. Henderson said that cars are allowed to drive and park on the sand in some areas of the beach . Police arrived on scene within minutes of getting a call about the trapped Reece family. The entire family was able to get out of the car before waves took the vehicle away .",

The Australian Air Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released its report on Wednesday into the 'wheels up landing' on December 12, 2014 at Jabiru Airport, southeast of Darwin. The unidentified pilot was flying a six-seat Cessna 310 aircraft, registered VH-TBE, with two adults and three children on board when he became distracted by one of the passengers.

A pilot has blamed one of his passengers for coughing 'incessantly' into his headset during a short flight in the Northern Territory which caused him to forget to put the landing gear down, an air crash report has found . The unidentified pilot was flying a six-seat Cessna 310 aircraft, registered VH-TBE, with two adults and three children on board when he became distracted by one of the passengers . 'The pilot of a Cessna 310 aircraft  was completing a charter flight from Oenpelli to Jabiru, Northern Territory,' the ATSB report read. 'During the short flight, one of the passengers coughed incessantly through the headset which distracted the pilot. Once he had the aircraft stable he reached over and unplugged the headset.' The pilot was further told the ATSB that the three children on board were 'excited and a little disruptive, and he had kept a close watch on their activities'. He then reported to have commenced his pre-landing checks and verbalised 'undercarriage down', but made a decision to 'leave this particular action until later on final approach'. The Australian Air Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) released its report on Wednesday into the 'wheels up landing' on December 12, 2014 at Jabiru Airport, southeast of Darwin . When he became aware of that the undercarriage remained retracted when the aircraft touched down, he landed the plane on the runway centreline and heard the propellers contacting the ground. He then steered the aircraft slightly to the left of the runway as he was mindful of another aircraft in the circuit behind him. 'This incident highlights the impact a combination of distractions can have on aircraft operations,' the ATSB report concluded. However the report also found the pilot was 'relatively new to the C-310'. 'In hindsight, he felt it would have been beneficial to have been familiarised with all the annunciators on TBE prior to flying the aircraft,' the report read. There were no injuries to either the pilot or passengers but the aircraft was 'substantially damaged'. A spokesman for the ATSB was unable to reveal the name of the pilot and the company involved. 'While details of the pilot and charter company are not secret it is not the remit of the ATSB to divulge that information,' the spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.",

His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble.

    "input": "Andrew Hutchinson was reported to the hospital trust where he worked for indecent behaviour five years before being convicted of sexual offences . Bosses at a hospital where a male nurse sexually assaulted patients were warned of his predatory behaviour five years before he was convicted of 23 different offences against patients. Andrew Hutchinson raped two patients while they were under general anaesthetic and assaulted others at John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford where he worked in the A&E department between 2011 and 2013. The 29-year-old was convicted of 23 separate charges last month including making indecent images of children, outraging public decency and voyeurism. He was taken into custody at Oxford Crown Court and is due to be sentenced next week. It has since emerged that an earlier complaint about the nurse was made to bosses at Oxford University Hospitals Trust. In 2009 a student nurse reported Hutchinson as having taken inappropriate photographs at the hospital. But the hospital didn't report it to police as they said there was not sufficient evidence to suggest whether there was grounds for a complaint. Instead bosses only mentioned it to authorities after being told of more serious allegations Hutchinson was facing. After his conviction, Oxford University Hospitals Trust said it was first made aware of any alleged sexual misconduct when contacted by police in 2014. In a statement spokesman Susan Brown said: 'November 2014 Thames Valley Police requested a meeting with the trust and at the meeting informed Oxford University Hospitals about the images they had found and that they believed some were taken on trust property. 'This is the first time that the Oxford University Hospitals were aware of the serious allegations of sexual assault, voyeurism and rape that took place in our hospital.' When contacted by MailOnline this afternoon Ms Brown said the 'important' thing was that the Trust reported the 2009 complaint after being made aware of the more serious charges. Hutchinson was reported to police separately after being caught filming women as they changed their clothes at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon. After searching his home police discovered photographs and video footage of him abusing women in the hospital. Some of his victims were unconscious at the time. CCTV footage from the leisure centre where Hutchinson preyed on women as they changed shows the nurse walking through its lobby . Staff at Oxford University Hospitals chose not to investigate the complaint made against Hutchinson while he was working at John Radcliffe Hospital (above) In 2010 Oliver Balicao, another male nurse at the hospital, was jailed for raping two female patients . One of his victims self-harmed after learning what had happened to her while she was under general anaesthetic. In 2010 Oliver Balicao, another male nurse at the hospital, was jailed for raping two female patients. As a result of the attacks , unconscious patients are now treated in an open area, a hospital source revealed. During a trial at Oxford Crown Court it was heard how Hutchinson had preyed on victims aged between 10 and 35. The nurse stole one of the hospital's cameras to be able to film up the skirt of a woman as she visited her sick friend and had become 'addicted' to spying on women and children, it was claimed. Once arrested police discovered more than 1,700 indecent images on his computer and phone. He will be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on April 27.",

    "input": "Mark Wood spent a day this week donning his newly arrived England suit. ‘I wore it around the house a bit too much really but I was absolutely buzzing just to have it on. ‘Trying it on is when the mixture of nerves and excitement started,’ says Wood, one of the uncapped members of Alastair Cook’s squad who fly to the Caribbean on Thursday for a three-Test series against West Indies. The 25-year-old would be forgiven for checking the fit, because standing at 5ft 11in and weighing just over 12st, he is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler. Mark Wood has been called up by England for the Test series against West Indies . When he’s not steaming in to bowl at 90mph Mark Wood can find himself fielding for long stretches of time. Thankfully the Durham paceman has the perfect remedy to keep things interesting during a lengthy stint on the boundary rope. ‘There are times when it gets boring in the field, so I bring out the imaginary horse and try to joust my team-mates,’ Wood said recently. ‘I don’t know how the England boys will take it, but I’ll have a go. I like to have a trot and feed him apples — he loves Granny Smiths. ‘Sometimes it’s just the pick-me-up the lads need. The horse will probably come with me to the Caribbean if he gets through immigration. If they don’t like it then I can just tie him up and leave him somewhere.’ But England are looking for something different in the wake of their woeful World Cup and Wood, whose ability to hurry batsmen from a short run-up is reminiscent of Craig White and Simon Jones from previous eras, fits the bill. Several players on the county circuit last season would testify that he was the slipperiest bowler they faced. ‘I can hit 90mph but it’s not something I tend to concentrate on,’ said Wood. ‘The quickest ball I have been clocked at on the telly was 91 but I am sure I can bowl quicker than that. ‘You know yourself, without the speed guns, when it’s coming out lovely and the rhythm’s there. ‘When I bowl I am not just trying to blast people out, I would like to think that being the slight lad that I am with a short run-up, it is more the surprise element that gets batters in trouble. I tend to rush them a little bit but would like to think I have more skills than just raw pace.’ Primary among those skills is a mastery of reverse swing. It was no coincidence that his first three County Championship appearances for Durham all came at Trent Bridge, where the abrasive nature of the square roughs the ball up perfectly for exponents of the art. Durham paceman is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler . But he has also displayed a marked improvement in his use of the new ball, swinging it to good effect whenever he got it during the 2014 season. Previously, he faced a battle to prise it from the hands of his Durham team-mates Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth. So a marker of his progress was provided at the turn of this year when he was opening the bowling for England Lions on the tour of South Africa. That breakthrough moment on the field has been replicated off it, with Wood’s devotion to the ECB’s fitness regime enabling him to play a string of matches following a career punctuated by injuries, including stress fractures of the back, a cyst on his left ankle, knee trouble and side strains. ‘My body type has changed a lot since I was the lad who broke through into the first team,’ he said. ‘I have done two winters now where they have basically pumped us up in the gym to get us stronger and fitter. ‘I did a four-week camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa, before Christmas when I was smashing myself along with the other fast bowlers. That got me the Lions call-up and off that, maintaining that strength, got me the Test call-up.’ Wood has sought advice from former Durham and England fast bowler Steve Harmison . His first-class haul of 74 wickets at 26 runs apiece is creditable even if his number of appearances, 23, is a bit thin. But as he showed in taking four Australia A wickets in as many overs in a Durham win at Chester-le-Street three years ago, he has the knack of getting good players out. It may help him sneak ahead of Liam Plunkett or Chris Jordan in the pace pecking order. ‘I am not going to the West Indies to make the numbers up. I want to play a Test match, whether it be the first, middle or last one,’ he said. ‘It’s a good opportunity. As an England fan it has been frustrating to watch during the winter but everyone will agree that to put things right we have to start in the Caribbean.’ It was for the carnage created at Sabina Park, Jamaica, that Steve Harmison, another cricketing son of Ashington, was renamed Grievous Bodily Harmison 11 years ago. ‘There’s no pressure on us, is there?’ said Wood. ‘The last lad from Ashington took seven for 12. But if I get half of that I will be doing all right. Steve’s a family friend so he’s offered me advice on what the pitches will be like and how I should go about things. The main thing he told me is that the stumps don’t move — we had a bit of a joke about that because of the ball he bowled in Brisbane (the first delivery of the 2006-07 Ashes, which went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip) — his point being that if you make sure you get the first one on target you’ll be fine after that.’ They are big shoes to fill but Wood appears comfortable in his own.",

    "input": "(CNN)ISIS fighters seized several districts in the Iraqi city of Ramadi in an hours-long assault Friday that included suicide and car bombs, an Iraqi provincial official said. At least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed in the attacks, according to Faleh al-Essawi, the deputy head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council. And the head of the Iraqi military operation in Anbar province, Gen. Qassim al-Muhammadi, was wounded. The northern Ramadi districts of Albu Faraj, Albu Essa and Albu Risha were in the hands of ISIS by the time the day was done. Located about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad, Ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months. ISIS took over parts of that western Anbar city in the first half of 2014, and it's been part of a tug of war ever since. Iraqi security forces discovered tunnels in February that they say could have led opposition fighters to a central government compound in the city.  But they didn't find all of them: A few weeks later, ISIS detonated hundreds of homemade bombs from a tunnel underneath an army headquarters there, according to Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar provincial council. More than 40 Iraqi soldiers died in that explosion. Iraqi and allied forces have made inroads in recent weeks, beating back the group that calls itself the Islamic State, which took over vast swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria last year. Their most high-profile victory, for instance, was the recapture of Tikrit. And U.S.-led airstrikes have already made a difference, according to officials in Washington and beyond. Still, ISIS remains a formidable force and, as the Ramadi assault shows, one that's still capable and willing to go on offense to take territory. That may be best illustrated by the case of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city and the site of one of its biggest embarrassments when Iraqi soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts as ISIS forces advanced last June. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern Iraqi city in April or May. But, on Thursday, a senior official in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration appeared to back away from that timeline -- saying an Iraqi-led assault on Mosul \"might be some time from now (or) might be soon.\" Calling for \"patience,\" an administration official said that winning Mosul is a complex endeavor. The same could be said for the entire effort to defeat ISIS. It will \"take a lot of capacity,\" the official said, \"and some time to build.\" CNN's Kim Acosta contributed to this report.",

The Gunners take on Brendan Rodgers' side at the Emirates, third in the Premier League and six points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool in the race for the top four. And in training ahead of the showdown, Arsene Wenger's side managed to appear relatively relaxed ahead of such a vital contest. Arsenal players target defender Laurent Koscielny (centre) with a friendly slap during training on Friday at London Colney . Wenger must be in high spirits having seen his side win all six matches they played in March as the Frenchman picked up the Manager of the Month award. Free-scoring Olivier Giroud, who fired in six goals over the month, completed the double to pick up the player accolade. Arsenal welcomed back Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta, Mathieu Debuchy and Abou Diaby to first-team training this week in a boost to their squad. The Gunners boss was however concerned over forward Theo Walcott's plummeting confidence after his disappointing run out for England in Turin. Wenger will have a heart-to-heart chat with Walcott ahead of Saturday's crunch top-four clash. Centre back Per Mertesacker (centre) takes his time getting back to his feet after a push from team-mate Calum Chambers .

Brazilian centre back Gabriel Paulista performs a stretch as the Arsenal squad limber up ahead of facing Liverpool on Saturday . With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool's visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: 'Yes, I'm worried about Theo's confidence. He's sensitive and I'm a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. 'He's not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. 'At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has a word alone with German defender  Mertesacker as they prepare to host top-four rivals Liverpool . Sanchez was messing around with the cameramen at London Colney, attempting to hide from the lenses . Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud, who won March Player of the Month award, holds off a challenge from team-mate Mikel Arteta . England forward Danny Welbeck is back in training despite picking up a knock on international duty at Wembley last week . Meanwhile Wenger was particularly coy over links to Liverpool's star Raheem Sterling. 'Sterling is a top player, but I don't want to get involved in that before a game,' Wenger told his news conference. 'That's down to Liverpool, I don't want to interfere in that. It's not my problem. I do not want to speak about any move. 'We are not in a transfer period, we are in front of a big game. I respect Liverpool and I do not want to go into any supposed move for any of their players.'

    "input": "A Chinese villager who was desperate to become a grandfather has been arrested for buying a wife for his son, then reselling her to another family after realising she was infertile. The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time. Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village. 'The whole thing is pathetic and detestable,' said Guo Jialun, head of the Guanyun County police station. The police is currently trying to track down Wang's real family.",

Beset by technical problems on its flagship Model S, Tesla in early 2013 was on the verge of bankruptcy, Bloomberg reporter Ashlee Vance said in an excerpt of his biography Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX And The Quest For A Fantastic Future, which will be published May 19. In March 2013, Musk contacted Google co-founder Larry Page, according to the excerpt, which cited two people close to the situation. Technology billionaire Elon Musk pursued a sale of his struggling electric-car company Tesla to Google for $6 billion before its share price rocketed in May 2013, according to a new biography . Musk proposed that Google buy Tesla for $6 billion and promise an additional $5 billion in factory expansions. He also demanded that he be permitted to run Tesla as a unit of Google for eight years, or until Tesla produced a third-generation car, the excerpt said. Page declined to comment on the matter, but told Vance that a 'car company is pretty far from what Google knows.' But Page, Vance reported, 'accepted the overall proposal' and the two sides began negotiating specific points. Tesla's fortunes changed suddenly in May 2013 when the company reported its first profit after an intense drive overseen by Musk to address technical glitches yielded a sudden jump in Model S orders. The surprisingly good earnings sent Tesla shares rocketing higher and ended the Google negotiations. Musk 'no longer needed a savior,' Vance wrote. Tesla's fortunes changed suddenly in May 2013 when the company reported its first profit after an intense drive overseen by Musk to address technical glitches yielded a sudden jump in Model S orders . Last year, Tesla was at the center of rumors that Apple was considering an acquisition of the company. Google, which has pursued technology for a self-driving car, earlier this year, along with investment giant Fidelity, pumped $1 billion into SpaceX, Musk's private space-travel technology venture.",

Maloney's effort, a fine solo run, before a thunderbolt shot from long-range was matched by a similar quality strike from Wildschut, who can also boast two first-team goals this term as well. Daniel Crowley pulled one back for Arsenal on the hour mark but the fight back proved to be too little too late. Crowley had scored a last-minute winner in October in the campaign's reverse fixture, but on Monday, Boro were able to exact their revenge and consolidated their position at the top of the Barclays Under-21s Premier League Division Two.

    "input": "Brian O’Driscoll believes Roman Abramovich style investment is needed to turn English clubs back into a European force but admits that scrapping the salary cap would be dangerous. With the French league becoming a honeypot for billionaire financiers – comic book tycoon Mourad Boudjellal has used his chequebook to turn Toulon into double European champions – the gulf between clubs from the Aviva Premiership and the Top 14 is bigger than ever. Saracens are the only English team featuring in this weekend’s Champions Cup semi-finals and, with the west London side being major underdogs against Clermont Auvergne, Ireland legend O’Driscoll believes the domestic game needs to readdress the balance. Brian O’Driscoll believes huge investment is needed to turn English clubs back into a European force . O'Driscoll says it's a money issue for English sides and they need Roman Abramovich style investment . ‘When you walk about French dominance, the teams are coming from France but the players aren’t,’ said O’Driscoll. ‘It’s a money issue – players are not just moving to France for a tan. The English utopia is that each club gets a Roman Abramovich, who makes it their little pet. ‘Then they are able to extend salary caps and attract better players. That married with the best of the English academy players coming through – of course they’d then be competitive again. But certain English clubs are being squeezed and the cap is there to save them. Not many clubs are profitable and you have to be careful because the long-term picture could be trouble.’ While Toulon have flexed their financial muscles by recruiting international stars such as Brian Habana, Matt Giteau and Leigh Halfpenny, English clubs have found themselves priced out of the market for southern hemisphere superstars. The trend looks set to continue after the World Cup, with All Black trio Dan Carter, Ma’a Nonu and Conrad Smith among those already signed up by Top 14 clubs. Clermont, who face Saracens in Saint Etienne on Saturday, have an impressive raft of imports including Jonathan Davies, Zac Guildford and Napolioni Nalaga. The Massif Central outfit, according to O’Driscoll, are the best club to never have been crowned European champions and should be the favourites for the title. New Zealand's Dan Carter has already signed with Racing Metro for after this year's World Cup . Saracens (pictured training this week) are the only English team left in the Champions Cup . Among those expats is full-back Nick Abendanon, who shone in the quarter-final victory over Northampton. O’Driscoll believes that, along with Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage, the Englishman should feature in this year’s World Cup - calling for the RFU to activate the ‘exceptional circumstance’ clause geared towards overseas players. ‘From a player point of view: yes they should both be be picked,’ said BT Pundit O’Driscoll. ‘They are the players playing the best at the moment and you pick on form. But when you set out your stall early and you then have to backtrack a bit, I don’t know if you lose a bit of face. You create your own stick to be beaten with. ‘It’s better to have guys coming in during the autumn than guys coming in now for the August matches: hurry, hurry, get to know one another, get some chemistry. That’s difficult. But class is class. What is the balance you go for? Personally, I think you play the best players.’ Watch Clermont Auvergne v Saracens exclusively live on BT Sport 1 this Saturday from 2.30pm. BT Sport is the only place to watch top live matches from the European Rugby Champions Cup, Challenge Cup and Aviva Premiership.",

    "input": "(CNN)When the earthquake hit, many of Nepal's most renowned pagodas in and around Kathmandu crumbled into rubble-covered stumps. Others were smothered under splintered hand-carved wooden beams or multi-level rooftops. But the Kathmandu Valley's other pagodas, stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to  structures which disappeared. The worst architectural losses have included the majestic Shiva temple pagoda and its twin, the Narayan temple pagoda, which dominated Kathmandu's main Durbar Square. From the late 1960s onwards, Western hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to Kathmandu would climb the Shiva pagoda's wide, nine-step plinth, sit in the shade under the triple-layered roofs, smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view. But now the two pagodas have been obliterated and the scene comprises pathetic piles of rubble, a bulldozer shoveling a path for vehicles, shocked and miserable witnesses and a sense of irreplaceable visual and spiritual loss -- unless the structures are eventually rebuilt. The Shiva temple pagoda may have been hundreds of years old, but before its destruction impoverished rickshaw drivers, coolies and others would publicly urinate into the gutter surrounding it while waiting for passengers or heavy loads to transport. The slightly shorter, triple-roofed Narayan pagoda allowed vegetable sellers to display their foodstuff on the temple's broad, five-level base. Both pagodas also served as public platforms. Jostling crowds of Nepalis and foreigners used to gather there because the plinths' height above street level allowed excellent views of major Hindu processions and other events. Those two landmarks fronted the enclosed dwelling place of Nepal's Hindu virgin goddess, or Kumari, whose ornate front of bricks, statues and carved wood seem to have survived the initial quakes. It is not immediately known if the inner courtyard and rooms are safe. On the other side of Durbar Square, the brick-and-wood Shiva-Parvati temple house -- where the Hindu gods Shiva and his consort Parvati shelter -- appear to also have survived. On Kathmandu's outskirts the town of Patan suffered terrible damage when its central Durbar Square lost several pagodas as structures pancaked straight down while others merely shook and cracked. Fortunately others appear to still be standing, including the Sundari Chowk temple and a surviving lucky trio of holy structures: the gray stone, Mogul-influenced Krishna Mandir; the 17th-century Bishwa Nath Mandir with its large stone elephants at the entrance; and the nearby smaller 17th-century Bimsen Mandi \"god of the traders\" pagoda. Several miles away from Kathmandu, witnesses have been unable to immediately confirm the levels of destruction which have occurred in the lavish town of Bhaktapur. The locality had undergone years of extensive restoration work thanks to foreign and local artists and funding. The town offset some of that cost by charging tourists a fee to enter its central area, which displayed refined temples, pagodas, shrines and even a restaurant built into a main pagoda, allowing diners to view the best sites while munching their meals. Elsewhere in the Kathmandu Valley, the white-topped dome of the Boudhanath Stupa remains standing, but its smaller neighboring stupa has shown some damage from the quake. The Boudhanath Stupa is prized by Tibetan Buddhist refugees who have fled their Chinese-occupied homeland on foot through the Himalaya mountains. They are often seen reverently walking in a circle around the stupa's base while twirling \"prayer wheels\" and chanting. There has been no news as yet on damage caused to other famous places of Hindu and Buddhist worship, including the hilltop Swayambhunath temple on the outskirts of Kathmandu. That imposing structure is popularly known as the \"Monkey Temple\" because its often vicious wild monkeys are allowed to scamper among the trees on the temple's hill, terrifying visitors who have to hike up a lengthy stairway to reach the temples, shrines, shops and monks' residences.. The fate of the Pashupatinath Temple complex near Kathmandu's international airport is also not known. Pashupatinath's multiple pagodas and shrines flank its public funeral pyres which emit smoke whenever human corpses are routinely cremated before the ashes are dumped into a narrow river.",

The 31-year-old has reportedly been transferred from HMP Manchester, formerly Strangeways, to Ashworth Hospital, a high-security psychiatric unit in Maghull, Merseyside. Cregan, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, was said to have started refusing food at the Category A jail after being moved to solitary confinement. Scroll down for video . One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan (above left) has reportedly been  moved from the Category A prison to the same secure psychiatric hospital as Moors murderer Ian Brady (above right) A source said told the Sun: 'He's playing the system. 'If he's offered a move he likes, he will start eating.' Brady, who was jailed for life in 1966, was sent to Ashworth Hospital over 30 years ago. Together with Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, he tortured and murdered five children in Greater Manchester between 1963 and 1965. In 2013 a mental health tribunal ruled that Brady should stay at Ashworth, despite the notorious killer arguing that he was not suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and should go back to jail. Cregan, who lost an eye in a brawl, was told he would die in prison when he was jailed for life without parole in June 2013. He was already on the run for the murders of David Short, 46, and son Mark, 23, when he killed the two policewomen after luring them to a house with a fake 999 call before shooting them 32 times on the doorstep and then throwing a grenade at them. It was claimed he was sent to solitary confinement at HMP Manchester last month after being caught smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his cell. Before the fallout sources told the Daily Star Sunday that Cregan had an enhanced status and was allowed additional time in the games area and yard, as well as a flat-screen TV and DVD player in his room.

The 250-piece collaboration - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. Now officially sold out by the retailer, pieces from the diffusion line have popped up on eBay - but those cruising the bidding site shouldn't expect to see the same original low prices paid by Target customers. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . Luckily for more patient shoppers who are looking for a second shot at buying from the preppy line, the outrageously-priced items that first became available on eBay have since been joined by more reasonably-priced pieces. Speedy re-sellers started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . The thousands of pieces available on eBay aren't just from buyers unhappy with their purchases, however. In fact, many re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of re-selling them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party . But though frustrated fans criticized Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. While Target won't be restocking the limited-edition collection, customers who refuse to shell out more than the retail value still have a shot at scoring Lilly Pulitzer pieces at low prices: Target has instated a 14-day return policy for the line, meaning rejected items will start popping back up in stores within the next two weeks.",

Half a million first time buyers will be helped onto the housing ladder every year by 2020, George Osborne pledged today. The Chancellor said he wanted a 1980s-style property 'revolution' after years of declining home ownership. He pledged to double the number of people buying their first home using government help-to-by schemes. Since 2010 there have been 1.2 million first-time purchases and Mr Osborne wants at least 2.4 million more over the next five years. Mr Osborne said he wanted to reverse the 'steady' decline in first-time buyers getting a home. He told Sky News: 'I'm a great believer in a home-owning nation; a home-owning democracy where families can get on the housing ladder. 'And the truth is that the number of first-time buyers has fallen steadily over recent years, and I want to reverse that, and I want to help families get on that housing ladder.' David Cameron added: 'We have acted on every front, we’ll continue to do so. We have reformed the planning system so that we can build houses. 'We have help to buy, which has helped thousands of young people onto the housing ladder. 'With the help to buy ISA, a new scheme that will help people save for a deposit. 'So we’re building the homes, we’re helping young people, we are creating an economy with jobs, we want to see a doubling in the number of first-time buyers. I believe Britain should be a home-owning democracy, that’s the goal.' It came after Mr Osborne told the Sunday Telegraph that he wanted a 'massive increase in the number of people who can own their own home'. He said: 'Home ownership is an absolutely core Conservative belief and aspiration that we support. 'In the next parliament I would like to see over a million more people helped into home ownership by a Conservative government. 'I would like to see us double the number of first-time buyers up to half a million. That is the kind of level we saw in the 1980s. 'There is no reason why our country can't achieve that again. That's a goal we set ourselves today.' The Chancellor of the Exchequer was campaigning with the Tory candidate for Brentford and Isleworth, Mary Macleod, at the Wyevale Garden Centre in west London today . David Cameron last week made a general election campaign visit to a housing development for first time buyers . Labour's Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said: 'More warm words on housing from the Chancellor will be cold comfort to the record number of young people and families priced out of home ownership over the past five years. 'Under this Tory-led government we've seen the lowest levels of housebuilding in peacetime since the 1920s and home ownership has fallen to a 30-year low. 'Labour's Better Plan will ensure Britain builds the homes working people need. 'Labour will get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020, backed by a comprehensive plan - the first in a generation - and a £5bn Future Homes Fund to support the building of homes for first-time buyers.'",

Controversial Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has secured an 8.92 stake in Rangers . Murray, Gilligan and Dave King ousted Ashley allies Derek Llambias and Barry Leach from the Ibrox board at an EGM on March 6 and have since spent time studying all the club's existing contracts and commercial arrangements. Sports Direct loaned the previous Rangers regime £5million in January, receiving security over various assets – including club trademarks – in return. They also have the right, yet to be exercised, to appoint two directors to the board. That deal also saw Ashley's firm take a 75 per cent grip of the Rangers Retail subsidiary, increasing their stranglehold over merchandising income. The new Ibrox board last month revealed they would not be drawing down the second £5 million available from Sports Direct, instead accepting a £1.5 million loan from the Three Bears consortium for short-term financing while they formulate a longer-term funding plan.

Millie Elia, an eighth-grade student from Oak Mountain, Alabama, died following the accident at Mount Cheaha State Park around 4.40pm on Saturday. The teenager had been rappelling on Pulpit Rockpark with her family and a friend when she fell. The park refused to release any further details when contacted by DailyMail.com on Monday. Tragic: Millie Elia, an eighth-grade student from Alabama, died on Saturday after a rappelling accident . In Oak Mountain on Monday, her classmates and teachers mourned the teen, who was part of the Advanced Symphonic Band, the National Junior Honor Society and the Science Club. Students wore blue to class in memory of Millie, decorated her locker with notes and photographs, and paid tribute to her on social media. 'Such a beautiful girl,' a fellow cheerleader wrote on Twitter as she shared images of Millie. 'Such a sad loss. Please send lots of love and prayers to the Elia's. We love you, Millie.' She added that prayers needed to go out to Millie's best friend because she had also been at the scene of the accident. 'Wish you were gonna be out there cheering with us,' she added. 'We'll be cheering for you girl. You're awesome, Mill! Fly high!' Principal Larry Haynes called her a 'very involved and well-liked student', WVTM reported. He emailed parents last night to tell them about the tragedy. Scene: The teenager fell around 60 feet while rappelling in Mount Cheaha State Park, pictured .

    "input": "Foreign GPs now account for 11 per cent of family doctors, new figure show . The number of GPs from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the NHS tries to combat a shortage of staff. Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two-thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the NHS is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that 22.0 per cent of current GPs gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19.8 per cent in 2004 . But the figure is 71 per cent in Barking and Dagenham, east London, 63 per cent in Medway, Kent, and 58 per cent in North Lincolnshire. The NHS is facing a shortage because many GPs are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The Royal College of GPs estimates that the NHS will need to hire at least 8,000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The NHS employs 40,584 GPs, of whom 8,941 are from overseas. This is up from 6,921 in 2004 when there were 34,855 family doctors in total. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘We need GPs from around the world to support the Health Service, and we simply don’t train enough. ‘We need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.’ The figures do not state where the foreign GPs trained but separate data from the General Medical Council shows many are from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Earlier this year UKIP leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not be working on the NHS as they didn’t speak good enough English . Earlier this year Ukip leader Nigel Farage sparked controversy by claiming that foreign GPs should not work for the NHS because they lack good English. He said: ‘Don’t we want to live in a country where we speak the same language? And isn’t it scandalous that we are not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country?’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The NHS – general practice included – is staffed by hardworking healthcare professionals from all over the world. 'We are very grateful for the work that doctors from overseas are doing.’ The NHS should train more staff rather than spending £2.5 billion a year on locum doctors and agency nurses, a think-tank has suggested. A larger pool of dependable permanent staff would also enhance workforce stability and patient safety, the cross-party Civitas said. The subsequent increase in competition for jobs would also help fill less desirable roles such as those in A&E departments and general practice. The think-tank said the typical charge for a consultant from an agency was £1,760 a day, equivalent to a salary of £459,000. Because the salary of an NHS consultant was between £75,249 and £101,451, four consultants could be employed for the price of one agency staff member.",

    "input": "It is the age-old trick of students the world over - pulling all-nighters to cram for an exam. But a team of experts at Brandeis University in Massachusetts have a few words of wisdom, urging students to put down the coffee and sleep. They believe the memory neurons that are responsible for converting short-term memories into long-term ones, work most effectively when a person is asleep. Scientists have long known that sleep, memory and learning are deeply connected. Most animals, from flies to humans, have trouble remembering when they are sleep-deprived. And studies have shown that sleep is critical in converting short-term memories, into long-term memory, a process known as memory consolidation. A team of scientists at Brandeis University in Massachusetts believe all-nighters to cram before an exam won't work because the process converting short-term memory to long-term memory is best carried out when a person is asleep . But just how that process works has remained a mystery. One body of thinking questions whether the mechanism that promotes sleep is also responsible for consolidating memory. While another asks if the two distinct process work together. In other words, is memory consolidated during sleep because the brain is quiet, allowing memory neurons to go to work, or are memory neurons actually putting us to sleep? Graduate students, Paula Haynes and Bethany Christmann, at the university's Griffith Lab, believe the answer is the latter. They focused their research on dorsal paired medial neurons, well-known memory consolidators in fruit flies. The pair noted, for the first time, that when the neurons are activated, the flies slept more, but when they were deactivated, the flies kept buzzing. These memory consolidators cause the flies to fall asleep, as they begin to convert short-term memory to long-term memory. Ms Haynes and Ms Christmann said this all takes place in a section of the fly's brain called the mushroom body - similar to the hippocampus in humans, which is where our memories are stored. The parts of the fly's mushroom body, which is responsible for memory and learning is the same part that keeps it awake. The hippocampus in the brain, highlighted in red, is where our memories are stored, and where, the scientists believe the process takes place . Ms Christmann, said: 'It's almost as if that section of the mushroom body were saying, \"hey, stay awake and learn this\". 'Then, after a while, the DPM neurons start signaling to suppress that section, as if to say, \"you're going to need sleep if you want to remember this later\".' Understanding how sleep and memory are connected in a simple system, like fruit flies, can help scientists unravel the secrets of the human brain. 'Knowing that sleep and memory overlap in the fly brain can allow researchers to narrow their search in humans,' Ms Christmann said. 'Eventually, it could help us figure out how sleep or memory is affected when things go wrong, as in the case of insomnia or memory disorders.' This research was funded by the National Institute of Health.",

    "input": "Jack Colback admits Newcastle United's supporters are being left short-changed as the club's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths. The 25-year-old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the Magpies lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours. But before this season is out Colback and his team-mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of Sunday's match against Spurs set to see thousands stay away from St James’ Park. Jack Colback (left) says the Newcastle United fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat . Newcastle lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager Alan Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. One year on and John Carver’s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue. And Colback accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required. The midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against Liverpool . ‘This is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment,’ said the midfielder, who was part of another lacklustre display during Monday’s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. ‘It’s a difficult situation we’re in – we’ve not got a lot of players. ‘But we can’t feel sorry for ourselves. We’ve got to make sure we perform this weekend. ‘If we play like we did in spells (at Liverpool) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year.’ Carver says Ashley has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer. Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a terrible tackle on Lucas Leiva to add to John Carver's woes . The head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby last weekend. But Colback said: ‘The character is there in the team, even though we didn’t show it last week (at Sunderland). ‘We had to show a reaction at Liverpool because last week was nowhere near good enough. ‘The minimum we could do is be better than the last game and I thought we were. ‘We should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react. We created the odd chance. ‘The penalty decision (Ayoze Perez was fouled by Dejan Lovren with the score at 1-0) was massive, it might have been a different game if we’d got that. Nothing seems to be going our way at the moment. Ayoze Perez (centre) was denied a stonewell penalty by under-fire referee Lee Mason in the first half . ‘But we’re not going to get any sympathy, we’ve still lost the game.’ Carver, meanwhile, will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save the season. The £6million signing was only days away from returning after a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he suffered a collapsed lung in February. De Jong – who has made just one Premier League start – was expected to miss the remainder of the campaign given that it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United’s reserves when they entertain Derby County this evening. Siem de Jong is in line to feature for the under-21's on Wednesday and his return would be a welcome boost .",

    "input": "Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid couldn't be separated in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final showdown on Tuesday. The two giants from the Spanish capital played out a goalless draw, meaning all is left to play for in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu. Here, Sportsmail rates the players in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Vicente Calderon. ATLETICO MADRID . Jan Oblak 9 - Blocked everything in the first half as a wind-assisted Real Madrid looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes. Had less to do in the second half but did it well. A man of the match display from the 22-year-old. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Juanfran 7 - He was rattled, along with the rest of the team, in the first half but he played his part in keeping Madrid at bay. Miranda 7 - Will not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside Godin - that is the third time this season Real have failed to score against Atletico Madrid at the Calderon and Miranda is a major reason for that. Diego Godin 7 - A rare slip early on let Bale in but the Welshman failed to punish the Uruguayan and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the European champions. At times in the first half he must have been seeing flashbacks of extra time in Lisbon but came through without conceding. Atletico Madrid centre-back Diego Godin rises higher than Sergio Ramos to attempt a header on goal . Guilherme Siqueira 6 - No mystery why Diego Simeone wants Felipe Luis back at the club next season. Siquiera is a threat going forward but a liability defensively and will be replaced in the summer. Arda Turan 7 - Always bright going forward and tested Casillas in the second period with a shot the Spain keeper did well to save. Will be vital in nicking a goal at the Bernabeu next week. Mario Suarez 6 - Forced a fine second-half save from Casillas but was just as blown away by Real in the first 45 minutes. Will still be a steal for someone at the end of the season if, as expected, he moves on. Gabi 6 - Simeone's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as Atletico took the initiative. Cristiano Ronaldo is crowded out by Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez (left) and Gabi . Koke 6 - Currently struggling to live up to those 'new Xavi' tags. Still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against Real's trio of Modric, James and Kroos. Antoine Griezmann 7 - You can see why he has scored 21 goals this season in a little over 40 games. He is always bright and showed pace and surprising strength in the first period to pull away from Ramos. Tough to play against and he will be important for Atletico on the break at the Bernabeu. Mario Mandzukic 7 - The old warhorse was elbowed by Ramos, bitten and punched by Carvajal and booked for complaining. He was a bloody hero too and had to be bandaged up midway through the second half. Still lacks that pace to pull away into space that Diego Costa has. Substitutes: Raul Garcia (Griezmann 77), Torres (Koke 83). Not used: Moya, Tiago, Saul, Jesus Gamez, Gimenez. REAL MADRID . Iker Casillas 7- Stayed awake in the first half as Real poured forward but Atletico Madrid still threatened on the break. Also kept out Mario Suarez' late shot as Real managed to hang on. Iker Casillas makes a save as Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres goes for the ball . Dani Carvajal 7 - Was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as Real tried to take advantage of Siqueira’s weakness. Also scrapped at the back and landed a punch and a bite on Manzukic as tempers frayed. That might still cost him his place in the second leg. Raphael Varane 8 - Real Madrid's best performer. We knew he was quick but how quick! His first half sprint down the right was worthy of Bale. Is there a quicker defender in Europe at the moment? Quite possibly not. When Pepe pulled out before the start of the game many Real Madrid fans would have feared the worst but Varane never put a foot wrong. Raphael Varane was in excellent form for Real Madrid in defence at the Vicente Calderon . Sergio Ramos 6 - Left trailing in Griezmann’s wake early on but was a match for Mandzukic. Solid but without the heroics of Lisbon and that last-minute goal. Marcelo 7 - Asked to attack less in the first half with Carvajal trying to do more damage on the other flank. Did all that was asked of him defensively without shining going forward as he can do. Booked and will not play second leg. Luka Modric 7 - Majestic in the first half as Madrid dominated but faded like his team in the second. Still the most complete midfielder that Real Madrid have and they were never going to lose 4-0 as they did in February without him. He will be vital in the second leg. Luka Modric was majestic in the first half for Real Madrid, but he faded along with the team in the second . Toni Kroos 6 - A shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as Madrid’s holder. Covered ground, got Madrid passing and still managed a shot that Oblak saved, but wouldn't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward? James Rodriguez 6 - Only just back from injury and it showed in the second half. Could easily have made way for Isco, who eventually replaced Benzema. Has magic in his boots and had a fine chance to win it on the night but couldn't take it. Gareth Bale 7 - Provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented Siqueira but they came to nothing and Madrid were left to rue the chance he had when Godin slipped and he was through on Oblak’s goal. He will be blamed because of that miss but worked hard and could still be key in the second leg with Atletico's weakness at left back. Bale missed an excellent opportunity to give Real the lead and a priceless away goal . Karim Benzema 5 - Struggles to score against Atletico and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard. Missed a fine chance in the second period when for some reason he flicked the ball back towards Ronaldo instead of trying to beat Oblak himself. Cristiano Ronaldo 6 - Had several free-kicks in the first half that failed to trouble Oblak, Also failed to connect with those excellent first-half crosses from Bale. Atletico Madrid are a tough nut to crack and the world’s most expensive forward line couldn’t find the vital away goal. Ronaldo was just as responsible as Bale and Benzema for that. Substitutes: Arbeloa (Carvajal 85), Isco (Benzema 76). Not used: Navas, Pepe, Khedira, Jese, Illarramendi. Ronaldo endured a frustrating evening as he was unable to find a breakthrough for his team .",

    "input": "The old adage that an elephant never forgets appears to be true, based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart. After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, while the pair joyfully flap their ears and caress each other with their trunks  in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary, in the north of the country. Me-Bai was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. Scroll down for video . It would appear to be true that an elephant never forgets, based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart (pictured) It is particularly sad because females tend to stick together in herds until they die, sharing incredibly strong bonds. They are very rarely separated before the calf is five years of age. The small elephant left the tourism trade 'because she [Me-Bai] was too young [and] began to lose weight and could not carry the tourists any longer,' according to Elephant News' YouTube page. Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after a tiring 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. The small elephant was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. They are pictured here togeher . Asian elephants remember old friends and have large social networks of friends, a 2011 study found. Researchers claimed that just like humans, some elephants are social butterflies, while other prefer to stick to a close-knit group of friends. Past studies suggested elephants usually live in small groups centred around females and their young while adult males live independently. However, the study found that though males do live apart, females and their young actually have the sort of complex network of friends, relatives and acquaintances normally seen in humans. Study author Dr Shermin de Silva from the University of Pennsylvania said: 'Elephants are able to track one another over large distances by calling to each other and using their sense of smell. 'So the 'herd' of elephants one sees at any given time is often only a fragment of a much larger social group. 'Our work shows that they are able recognise their friends and renew these bonds even after being apart for a long time.' 'Me-Bai was nervous and wary of people when she first arrived at the sanctuary, but she quickly learned that her new caretakers had no intention of abusing her in any way,' the sanctuary writes. She was initially wary of humans but quickly adjusted to her new surroundings, National Geographic reported. Workers learned that Me-Bai's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire Mae Yui so she could join her young at the sanctuary. The emotional moment the pair were reunited was captured on camera. It shows the elephants caressing each other with their trunks and flapping their ears – seemingly in joy - after spending an uncertain half an hour together where the keepers thought they may be worried about being separated again. A previous study conducted at the park by Mahidol University in Thailand and Emory University in the US, found that elephants comfort each other when they are stressed by chirping softly and stroking each other's heads and genitals. These actions can be seen in the video. Psychologist and elephant behaviour expert, Preston Foerder, of the University of Tennessee, said the elephants are communicating with touch, as well as sound and sight, because their trunks are so sensitive. The duo can be seen walking and eating together happily, later in the video. After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small calf can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, and joyfully flapping her ears in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary in the north of the country . However, animal behaviour expert Frans de Waal of Emory University, said that it's possible the elephants don't remember each other, but are just a compatible pair. 'There is no doubt about elephant feelings and bonding, but we humans like to read the mother-child relation into this,' he said. 'It is possible the two remember each other but the video itself does not necessarily prove this.' Whatever the case, the sanctuary says: 'Now, Mae Yui's owners and Elephant Nature Park are working together to rehabilitate Mae Yui and Me-Bai so that they can return to the wild and live free.' Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after an exhausting 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. Here the pair walk towards each other at the sanctuary . Workers learned that Me-Bai's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire Mae Yui so she could join her young at the sanctuary .",

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards . Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world . Despite national earnings that make us the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a ‘social progress index’ suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers – for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: ‘Overall, within Europe the UK’s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) ‘The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK’s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.’ The table – which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world – lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: ‘A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.’",

The motorist attempted the dangerous manoeuvre on the A39 between Street and Glastonbury in Somerset on Tuesday morning after becoming stuck behind the HGV for several miles. The driver gambled on finally passing lorry driver, Nick Townley, at a set of lights but badly miscalculated as the road narrowed and lost control at 50mph. An impatient driver who attempted to overtake a lorry lost control and destroyed the caravan he was towing . The dramatic moment was captured on dash cam by the HGV driver that the motorist had tried to overtake . He swerved in front of the truck and his caravan whiplashed into a lamppost, smashing the rear into smithereens and spilling the contents across the road. The car ended on the opposite side of the road - forcing oncoming traffic to slam on their brakes - with what remained of the caravan still attached. The moment was captured on camera by a dash cam fitted to the cab of 49-year-old Mr Townley's lorry. He had been slowly accelerating his 22-tonne truck to nearly 30mph when the collision happened and managed to perform an emergency stop inside just 20 yards. The driver had been stuck behind the 22-tonne lorry for several miles and gambled on overtaking after a set of traffic lights. But he appeared to misjudge the gap and collided with the front of the lorry's cab . He swerved in front of the truck and his caravan whiplashed into a lamppost, smashing the rear into smithereens and spilling the contents across the road. The accident closed the road for several hours as police cleared up the debris and questioned the driver . Mr Townley, from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, who has been an HGV driver for 24 years, said he was so shaken by the accident he had difficulty sleeping that night. He said: 'I was stopped at the lights and there was one car by the side of me, the red one. 'There was a box van behind me which had been there from the time just after I came off the M5. 'We pulled off from the lights. As I was going through the gears the red car passed me. 'I looked in the mirror and saw the box van was not trying to pass... but less than 8 to 10 seconds later I glanced in the mirror as something caught my attention. The lorry driver, Nick Townley, was so shaken by the accident he had difficulty sleeping that night . Mr Townley posted his dramatic footage on Facebook where scores of people condemned the caravan driver . 'This is when I hit the horn and the brakes as hard as I could. I stopped the lorry in around 20 yards and got up on the kerb as much as I dare. 'I was not trying to block him out as some people suggest - he came through the lights at about 50 mph.' He posted his dramatic footage on Facebook where scores of people condemned the caravan driver. The accident closed the road for several hours as police cleared up the debris and questioned the driver. No one is thought to have been seriously injured in the crash.",

With the ancient Inca city featured on bucket lists the world over, visitors queuing up for the perfect photo of its other worldly beauty, it's not surprising that cracks are starting to show. Since 2011, the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by Peru and UNESCO. Last year 1.1million people reached its dizzying peak. Scroll down for video . Entry to the site will be moved to a visitor and orientation centre and there will be three routes through the site . And now a new master plan, to be implemented between 2015 and 2019, has been revealed, calling for the re-conceptualisation' of Machu Picchu. According to the Andean Air Mail and Peruvian Times, the idea is to change the 'axis of the visitor experience' making the mountain into a part of the tourist experience as well as the Inca city itself, with the hopes that this can control crowd flow - the project is set to cost around £28.5million. Entry to the site will be moved to a visitor and orientation centre in the jungle below, and there will be three different routes through the site. A staff of certified guides and guards will be employed, and security cameras installed. Certified guides and guards will be employed, and security cameras installed as part of the grand plan . Also, time limits will be imposed to keep traffic flowing. An online document outlining the plan states: 'Groups of 100 visitors will leave approximately every 10 minutes (from the visitor’s centre) toward any of the possible options, easing up the congestion on the heritage space with the aid of interpretive signs and a more efficient action by the guides.' So if groups of 100 are dispatched every ten minutes, the site would receive around 6,000 visitors per day, which works out as over two million a year. Plans have also been agreed for an exit ramp, as well as onsite toilets. Since 2011, the number of average daily number of visitors has far exceeded the daily limit of 2,500 agreed to by Peru and UNESCO . In 2008, UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture and the Peruvian Government agreed that no more than 2,500 people should visit the site per day. Due to a lack of emergency management, limited road access from Santa Maria and Santa Teresa and poorly managed waste facilities, increasing numbers of tourists would be potentially very dangerous. The new master plan aims to tackle all of those issues, but it could be argued that the sacred Inca city might never be the same again. Journey Latin America's Peru expert, Isabelle Mazille, told Mail Online Travel: 'Machu Picchu is not a museum, but an experience – and people go time and time again to visit certain areas. 'So with this idea of having a specific route from which you cannot deviate, being able to go with a guide only and in short slots will definitely affect the experience; it won’t be the same. 'But on the other hand – and this is the main issue – based on the increasing number of visitors, the authorities need to do something to accommodate (and control) them as otherwise the site will crumble. 'On the positive side, a visitor and orientation centre is a good idea which will help organise and disperse the crowds'.",
    "output": "Peru's famous Inca ruins received 1.1million visitors in 2014 alone .\nAverage number of tourists far exceeded UNESCO'S daily limit of 2,500 .\nExtravagant new plans aim to allow for more tourists to visit safely ."

Townsend celebrates his strike with Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Ryan Mason (left) and Kyle Walker . In his column for skysports.com, Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn’t get in the squad?' ‘He said when the squad was announced that I should be “nowhere near the squad”. It didn’t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I’ve done that as I always have.’ Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: ‘Not bad for a player that should be “nowhere near the squad” ay @PaulMerse?’ The Tottenham’s winger’s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: “Oh ye of little faith #Merson get in.’ They could also have pointed out that Townsend’s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. ‘You can never stop proving things to people,’ said Townsend. ‘But I think every time I’ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson’s point. Townsend’s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. ‘I can’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,’ admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. ‘The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s my best form but this is the best form I’ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I’m over the worst of that. ‘I’m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.’ After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. ‘He is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,’ said Townsend. ‘As soon as the whistle went, I thought I’d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.’ Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break .",

Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley’s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield’s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes’ aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean’s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley’s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 .

    "input": "Ironing may be the Marmite of household chores. But, love it or loathe it, unless you want to look like you’ve slept on a park bench, you can’t avoid it. British company Swan, which sold its first iron in 1933, has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron, for £279.99. But does it really make things easier? Tessa Cunningham finds out. SUPER STEAMER . Swan SI9031N Steam Generator Iron, £279.99, swan-brand.co.uk . If you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost £300, then Swan’s luxury model could be the one for you. It cut my ironing time by half. It’s usually my least favouite chore, but when testing this one, I got to work in front of Poldark and was done within 20 minutes. Because all the water is in the separate 1,000ml generator tank, the iron itself is lightweight. The steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron, shooting out at 90g per minute — twice as fast as conventional steam irons (think of the difference in power between jet-washing and using a hosepipe) — cutting through creases quicker. As well as being more powerful, it also produces twice as much steam, making shorter work of wrinkles. On the downside, despite the investment, you get only a two-year guarantee. 3/5 . PRECISION PERFECT . Philips Easy Speed Plus, £29.50, amazon.co.uk . The big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip, which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease, making it perfect for shirts and trousers. I also love the vertical steam option, which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics, such as curtains, by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button. Steam output is 35g per minute — with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases. Impressive for the price. 4/5 . BARGAIN BUY . Swan Steam Iron SI1001ON, £19.99, argos.co.uk . This does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money — including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control, which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam. But it’s so heavy, at 1.3kg, that I’m in danger of developing muscles like Popeye if I keep using it. And while the dolphin-shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas, such as around shirt buttons, it makes the iron look downright ugly. I also found the soleplate scaled up quickly. 2/5 . POWER HOUSE . Braun TexStyle 7 TS755, £49.99, johnlewis.com . This looks like a fighter jet, and is so heavy (1.3kg empty and 1.65kg when the water tank is full) it makes ironing even more of an effort. On the plus side, the ergonomic handle is easy to hold. I also like the way the cable is 2.5m long — useful if you can’t get near a plug. It’s impressively powerful. Steam shoots out at 50g per minute and the precision shot also releases steam at 170g per minute. 3/5 . LIGHTWEIGHT PRO . Russell Hobbs Autosteam Pro Iron, £19.99, argos.co.uk . One of the cheapest irons I tried, this is beautifully lightweight at 1.14kg despite having a large 320ml water tank. There are lots of functions such as a non-stick soleplate and a vertical steam option. You also get a generous two-metre cord. But it falls down on the one job I’m paying for — ironing. Although it is supposed to be non-drip, it leaked at low temperatures and left unsightly marks on my silk shirt. 2/5 . VALUE FOR MONEY . Philips PerfectCare Pure Steam Generator, £119.99, robertdyas.co.uk . The nearest rival to the Swan iron and less than half the price, this is fantastic value for a top-range model bursting with extras. I normally dread ironing my grandmother’s thick linen table cloth, but I removed every crease in seconds with no effort. It’s all thanks to the impressive 1.5-litre water reservoir which pumps out high-pressure steam at 110g per minute. And the soleplate is designed so steam is distributed evenly — meaning fewer strokes and speedy ironing. The manufacturer boasts that you never need to change the settings as it creates the perfect temperature level whether you are ironing silk PJs or kids’ jeans. I tried it — and it was true. You also get a five-year guarantee. 5/5 . CORDLESS POWER . Tefal Freemove FV9970, £79.99, johnlewis.com . Tefal is hugely proud of its cordless iron. And with good reason. The base recharges the iron during each rest period, which means there is no cord getting in your way, and the control panel lets you know when you need to recharge. It’s powerful, too — delivering an impressive 180g per minute shot of steam. The handy steam on-demand trigger got rid of stubborn creases in my partner’s shirts. It also has a vertical steam option.

    "input": "Commuters are now able to make phone calls and send texts on the Tube following the launch of new technology enabling phone calls via an internet connection. In what is the first roll out of the technology throughout Europe, the Wi-Fi Calling feature is designed to facilitate calls and texts when users have no mobile phone signal. The technology paves the way for London's commuters to chat and text inside the capital's 150 Tube stations where Wi-Fi connections are currently available. London's Underground platforms could soon be drowned in the sound of commuters chatting on their phones . iPhone users on EE will find their calls and texts automatically connect through the internet when they have no service signal. An EE spokesman said: 'Starting today, iPhone customers on EE can make and receive high quality calls over WiFi and send text messages, using their own phone number with no need to use an app - great for when a mobile signal is unavailable.' While it is already possible to make phone calls or send messages via Wi-Fi with apps such as WhatsApp and Viber, the new technology works automatically in the user's phone. After having downloaded the update, EE users on iPhone will see a Wi-Fi Calling section appear in the settings app of their phone, which must be switched to allow to enable the feature. The telecoms firm also confirmed that the new Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge will also have the feature on the EE network when it goes on sale this Friday. Rival networks, including O2 and Three, offer apps in order to make calls over Wi-Fi - similar to the Skype service - while Vodafone has said it will be launching a Wi-Fi calling service 'in the summer'. The telecoms firm is currently in the process of being taken over by BT in a deal worth £12.5billion that could see further combinations of technology in order to boost mobile phone reception in the future.",

    "input": "A South Australian law professor has said that police acted ‘outrageously’ by subjecting a woman to an oral swab test after she was reported for flashing her breasts. Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However, ABC News reports that South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . ‘I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,’ he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. ‘That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.’ The 38-year-old was captured streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.",

According to Variety, Pfeiffer's role will be that of a morning news anchor, making it very similar to the real life role Couric played as co-host of Today for 15 years. Couric will serve as an executive producer and help 'ensure the series strikes realistic notes.' The creator behind the project, English, was previously the brains behind Brown, the show starring Candice Bergen that centered around a female news anchor and ran for ten seasons, winning 18 Emmys. English would also serve as a writer, producer and showrunner on the program. The ladies are currently in talks with HBO, Showtime, AMC, Netflix and Amazon to pick up the program. Couric will serve as an executive producer, drawing on her experience as an anchor on Today for 15 years . Pfeiffer would be the one of the biggest stars yet to move to television, joining a group that now includes House of Cards stars Robin Wright and Kevin Spacey, True Detective leads Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and even Lady Gaga, who recently announced she would be appearing on the next season of American Horror Story. The actress has kept a low profile for the past 20 years since becoming a mother, only doing a handful of films in that time.

    "input": "When booking a holiday it is easy to be confused when it turns out your flight to Vancouver in Canada goes to airport code YVR, or why you will be landing in Malaga, Spain, at an airport with the code AGP. While many main airports have codes which make sense, such as JFK for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, of LHR for London Heathrow, others can leave passengers baffled - or in fits of laughter. From unfortunate codes such as OMG and SUX to the funny LOL, there are some seemingly very random three-letter combinations around the world. Scroll down for video . Airline Codes features 438 airports from 94 countries, allowing users to finally understand why certain airlines are tagged as they are . Two aviation fans set out to document the world's airport codes and explain how they were chosen with their website Airport Codes. Listing the origins of 438 airports from 94 countries, they explain the reasons behind the unusual acronyms, such as why many Canadian airport codes begin with the letter Y. COK - Cochine International Airport in India takes its code from the fact it is based in the city of Kochi. DOH - Qatar's glitzy new airport is named for the capital Doha. AGP - Malaga Airport didn't want to take its first three letters from the city name as mal means bad in Spanish. So instead it is AGP, taking 'AG' from the middle of the word and filling with the letter 'P'. SUX - Iowa's Sioux City airport ended up with the unfortunate three letter code SUX and have tried to change it many times. Now it has embraced the name with the tag line 'Fly Sux'. ORD - Chicago O'Hare endedup with the unusua;l flight code which points to its past as Orchard Field. MSY - New Orleans Louis Armstrong's code reflects aviator John Moisant and the nearby Moisant Stock Yards. OMG - Omega Airport in Namibia has the somewhat hilarious code of OMG, which is often used as shorthand for 'oh my God'. LOL - in the spirit of unusual acronyms, the term usually use din text messages to signify 'laugh out loud' is actually Derby Field airport in Nevada, serving Lovelock City (hence the code). When codes were generated in the 1930s, old broadcast radio codes were sometimes used. In Canada, radio stations used Y, and this was reflected in the majority of their airport codes starting with the same letter, as shown with YWG representing Winnipeg. The Australian Business Traveller stated that during the first days of air travel, airports were given a two letter 'weather station' code. As the amount of airports increased worldwide, this two-digit number rose to three so each could be given a unique code. Cities with similar starting names like Dublin and Dubai caused the labelling to deviate from a regular system, with Dubai adopting DXB, when DUB was already assigned to Dublin. The codes are known as IATA location identifiers, and are set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The triple characters are displayed on luggage tags at airport check-in desks, to ensure they reach the correct destination. Full lists of the code are published biannually in the IATA Airline Coding Directory. Co-creator Lynn Fisher said she was inspired following hearing a talk about the rationale behind IATA airport codes. 'Ever since I’ve found it interesting and recently did a web search to see if there was a site that compiled all of those stories,' the Arizona-based designer said. 'Nothing came up, so we decided to make one. 'Many airports change names over the years so their airport codes might reflect a previous identity or purpose. 'It’s especially surprising (and interesting) when the code comes from very early or even unofficial designations.' Homer's favourite airport! Airline Codes explains why Hamad International Airport ended up with the DOH code . Many recognise LAX to be the code for Los Angeles Airport, but the extra X on the end has baffled travellers for a while, and can be explained by the transition from two letters to three . The inclusion of an extra letter is the explanation behind the famous LAX code, which was just LA during the 1930s. The airport added the extra X around 1947 to reflect the change in the number of required letters. Several others similarly adopted the X, which can be seen in airport codes such as PDX for Portland, and DXB for Dubai. Codes were sometimes worked out using the city it was located, followed by the name of the airport itself, for example LHR was used for London Heathrow and LGW for London Gatwick. One of the funnier airport codes is Cochin International Airport in Kochi in India, which reverses the first three letters of its place name . Portugal’s second busiest airport, Porto uses the code OPO. It is named after  its alternate English spelling: OPOrto. Confusingly there are exceptions to the rule, with London Stansted airport being given the STN as its code. Perhaps the most entertaining tale on the site is the story of Iowa's Sioux City airport. The unfortunate code for this airport is SUX, which they tried multiple times in vain to change. Once accepting defeat, they used the code to their advantage, using the memorable phrase 'Fly Sux.' Co-creator software engineer Nick Crohn said: 'That’s probably one of the things that’s most enjoyable about the codes. 'They are keys to the airport’s history. 'ORD for Chicago O’Hare points to its past as Orchard Field and MSY for New Orleans Louis Armstrong reflects aviator John Moisant and the nearby Moisant Stock Yards. Lynn admitted the codes that make words like FAT, for Fresno in California, are her favourite. Instead of Malaga Airport using the code MAL, which translates in Spanish as bad, they opted for taking the middle letters from Malaga, and adding a P . Travellers going to Beijing Capital International may be confused to see PEK on their luggage tags. However this is from older English spelling of Beijing, which was PEKing .",
    "output": "The three-letter airport codes are known as IATA location identifiers .\nSome follow a pattern like SYD for Sydney and MEL for Melbourne .\nOthers don't seem to make any sense, like ORD for Chicago .\nAirline Codes explains how each airport got its identifying code ."

PSG were knocked out 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona despite Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti returning to the Ligue One side but coach Laurent Blanc was not really shocked. 'Those who follow Barcelona know the patience required to win the Champions League. You need the means, but also some patience,' Blanc said after the 2-0 defeat at the Nou Camp, which followed last week's 3-1 humbling at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc looks on as his Paris Saint-Germain side were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona . 'The first qualified for the semi-finals are Barca and Bayern Munich. Paris will certainly be there one day but you have to understand we need time,' he said after PSG's third successive quarter-final exit in the tournament. Once again, Sweden striker Ibrahimovic failed to shine in a big game in which his attacking partner Edinson Cavani, despite his limitations, seemed more involved. PSG saw off Chelsea in the previous round but that was more of a one-tie thing, with Thiago Silva and David Luiz scoring after Ibrahimovic had been sent off in the second leg. Luiz was below-par in the last two games, being at fault on four of the five goals PSG conceded against Barca, but PSG's problems are collective, conceded midfielder Blaise Matuidi. Blaise Matuidi says that PSG are still not ready to win the Champions League and still have work to do . David Luiz was given a torrid time over the two legs and was at fault for four of Barcelona's goals . 'Barcelona are an institution, a club who have been at the top level for a long time, like Real Madrid or Bayern Munich,' the France international said. 'We have been around for five years only.' PSG were bought in 2011 by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), who invested massively in the club hoping to win Europe's premium club competition. While they never look threatened in the Group stage, PSG have been failing against top-notch opposition. 'Let's be realistic, they were better than us. They will probably win the Champions League,' Ibrahimovic admitted. Star men Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) and Marco Verratti were unable to influence the game in PSG's favour . 'As far as we are concerned, it is not possible to reach that goal on short term. We have made several big steps and we were eliminated by a superb team. 'Let's not lie to ourselves, it's just reality.' PSG will now focus on winning the Ligue 1 title for the third consecutive season -- a goal more suited to their capacities -- with a possible treble on the cards as they won the League Cup and will play the French Cup final on May 30. They are second in the standings behind Olympique Lyonnais on goal difference but have a game in hand.",

While a rivalry like this one can capture the imagination of a city - and there is no doubting by the build up that Milan had been hit by derby fever - it takes a concoction of quality, intensity and passion to hold the attention of the average neutral. Not all elements were present at the San Siro. A goalless first half had produced the odd burst of quality, but little intensity. A goalless second provided little more. Former Chelsea defender Alex sees his attempt blocked by Inter keeper Samir Handanovic, in one of the game's few clear-cut chances . Philippe Mexes thought he had scored an own goal, as did his keeper Diego Lopez, but it was ruled out and the game remained goalless . Suso steps away from Inter forward Rodrigo Palacio as both sides showed endeavour, but very little quality . Suso jumps for the ball as Juan Jesus watches on, as the two sides struggled to create clear chances . Inter: Handonvic, Jesus, Vidic, Ranocchia, D'Ambrosio, Kovacic (Shaqiri 77), Medel, Gnoukouri (Obi 67), Hernanes, Palacio, Icardi . Booked: Jesus, Medel, D'Ambrosio, Hernanes . Milan: Lopez, Mexes, Abate, Antonelli, Alex (Paleta 70), Poli (Cerci 81), Van Ginkel, De Jong, Menez, Suso (Destro 73), Bonaventura . Booked: De Jong, Abate . There was plenty of passion on show, but that was largely displayed by both sets of supporters. That both sides are struggling was obvious from the pre-match build up. The painstaking effort put into pre-match choreographies of both Inter's Curva Nord and Milan's Curva Sud emphasised that this was no ordinary derby. There was much riding on it. This was their season in a nutshell. And so it proved on the pitch. A wayward pass from former Cardiff City man Gary Medel after just 51 seconds set the tone, his searching long ball falling straight into the hands of Milan keeper Diego Lopez, with umpteen other options on. There were glimmers of the potential Roberto Mancini's Inter possess. Hernanes almost lit up the occasion with a wicked left-footed shot that had to be beaten away by Diego Lopez as it threatened his top corner. Mateo Kovacic attempted something similar three minutes later, only his effort failed to find the target. There was insight into why both sides are languishing in mid-table this season too. Juan Jesus' momentary blip saw him almost turn Jeremy Menez's cross into his own net, while Lopez was almost caught on the ball by Mauro Icardi. These are the unnecessary nervy moments that the top teams tend to avoid. Milan's chances were few, Suso providing Samir Handanovic with his first action of the game after 20 minutes, a routine stop from a stinging shot after the Liverpool loanee cut in from the right. At the other end Inter's front two of Rodrigo Palacio and Icardi huffed and puffed, but to no avail. Philippe Mexes and Alex continued to trump the hosts' attack with their experience, last ditch tackles and interceptions halting them at every turn. Both under-pressure managers, Filippo Inzaghi (left) and Roberto Mancini, gesticulate as their sides struggle to find a way through . Despite the disappointing seasons both sides are experiencing, the atmosphere was electric in the San Siro . As expected though, there was no lack of enthusiasm on the pitch. Gary Medel hasn't mellowed a bit since his move from Cardiff to Inter last summer. He continued to fly into tackles, picking up a booking for a foul on Suso. Another usual suspect joined him in the book just after the half hour mark as Nigel de Jong was cautioned after scything down Kovacic as the Inter midfielder tried to launch a counter attack. Jesus continued to prove a source to be exploited for Milan, his lack of concentration allowing Suso to nip in and start another foray into the Inter area, this time Handanovic dealt with Menez's low cross. There was no lack of bite from either side, and it proved a baptism of fire for 18-year-old Assane Demoya Gnoukouri, the midfielder making his first ever start for the Nerazzurri following just 11 minutes against Hellas Verona last week. He did himself no harm, showing plenty of nice touches and never looked overawed by the occasion. His warm reception as he came off just after the hour mark was well-deserved. He'll have plenty more derby days ahead of him. Inter fans light fireworks in the stands as they two sets of fans attempted to inject some life into the game . The fans produced an array of stunning banners which were shown off before kick off . An Inter flag is waved  as fans geared up for a derby that may mean less this year in terms of league position, but still matters to the locals . Inter cranked up the pressure after the break. Palacio was presented with the best opening off the match when he rounded Lopez, but having already seen a goal chalked off for offside, he was denied by the body of Alex who had raced back to clear off the line. Palacio then broke down the centre and fed Hernanes down the left. His cross was turned into his own goal by Mexes and Inter thought they had the lead. Referee Luca Banti and his official thought otherwise as the goal was ruled out for offside. It was the third disallowed of the game. In stoppage time Icardi flashed wide and Alex's acrobatic effort at the far post almost stole the points for The visitors. But by then, the rest of the world had switched off. The Milan Ultras show their support as their team looked to move back into the race for a Europa League spot . Nigel de Jong tackles Inter midfielder Hernanes as both sides scrapped hard, but neither could find the vital breakthrough .",

Sarah Jones, representing Crook, 50, said the blunder could have forensic consequences for his case. Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model.

It's the latest shocking act by the Islamists who are waging a campaign of terror against other religions that has involved mass beheadings and raping. The images were posted on social media, including the Shomoukh Al-Islam jihadi forum, under the title Leveling Graves And Erasing Pagan Symbols. Terrorist group ISIS has released photographs of its militants destroying Christian graves with sledgehammers and carving out crosses in the Iraqi city of Mosul . It's the latest shocking act by the Islamists who are waging a campaign of terror against other religions that has involved mass beheadings and raping . The group released a statement with the images that attempted to justify the mass desecration. It said that graves above the ground suggested that the dead person was closer to Allah than the living, so must be demolished and any images on the graves must be erased. The statement stems from a collection of Islamic teachings known as the hadith, which many Muslims reject. Steven Stalinsky, executive director of The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), told FoxNews.com that by posting the images on social media, the group was sending a message to the West. He said: 'It is important to note that ISIS is documenting its destruction and desecration of Christian sites and its attacks on Christian communities, and on other minorities' sites and communities, and is disseminating these images worldwide via social media. The group released a statement with the images that attempted to justify the mass desecration. It said that graves above the ground suggested that the dead person was closer to Allah than the living, so must be demolished and any images on the graves must be erased . Christians have suffered considerably at the hands of Isis, with many in Iraq and Syria forced by the militants to choose between leaving their homes, facing death or paying a traditional tax on non-Muslims . One expert said that Isis released the video to mock the West, to show that it is powerless to stop the group doing whatever it wants . 'By doing this, ISIS is not only showcasing what it is doing, but is also mocking the West by demonstrating that it is doing so freely, with no one trying to stop it.' Christians have suffered considerably at the hands of Isis, with many in Iraq and Syria forced by the militants to choose between leaving their homes, facing death or paying a traditional tax on non-Muslims. Earlier this year Isis released a video showing militants beheading 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya and Yazidis have told of fighters abducting hundreds of girls and women and subjecting them to rapes and beatings. Isis' attack on Iraq's heritage, meanwhile, recently saw Nimrud, once the jewel of Assyria and home to a treasure considered one of the 20th century's main archaeological finds, destroyed by explosives and men armed with power tools. The UN's cultural agency condemned the act on Monday. 'I condemn this mad, destructive act that accentuates the horror of the situation,' UNESCO head Irina Bokova said in a statement. The Islamic State group on Saturday circulated an undated video showing militants equipped with sledgehammers and power tools breaking artefacts before rigging the site with large barrels of powder. The subsequent footage shows a massive explosion and its aftermath, suggesting the ruins of Nimrud - which lie on the Tigris about 30 kilometres (18 miles) southeast of IS-held Mosul - were largely levelled. Nimrud, founded in the 13th century BC, is one of the most famous archaeological sites in a country often described as the cradle of civilisation. 'With their hammers and explosives they are also obliterating the site itself, clearly determined to wipe out all traces of the history of Iraq's people,' Bokova said.",

Caitlin Kellie-Jones suffered from Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood. To control the condition Caitlin was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth to keep her at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees for 72 hours. Nicola Kellie-Jones and partner Paul with children Caitlin and Dylan are raising money to help other children . Medics gave little Caitlin, pictured, hypothermia in a bid to prevent any brain damage . Caitlin, pictured, was diagnosed with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy minutes after she was born . It allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen. Thankfully, Caitlin, now ten months old, recovered from HIE and is able to feed and play. Her parents, Nicola and Paul, are hoping it will not have affected her ability to walk and talk but they must wait to find out. Ms Kellie-Jones,  27, from Chorley, Lancashire, said: 'Caitlin was in an incubator surrounded by doctors and nurses. 'She wasn't moving or breathing for herself, and was making no noise. 'I had an image in my mind of our first cuddle which was taken away. Doctors were telling us she was very poorly and just to take it hour by hour. 'It was such a relief to bring her home.' Caitlin was born on May 10 last year weighing 7lbs 4oz after a normal pregnancy. She was whisked away by doctors immediately to be placed on a specialist cooling machine. Despite her ordeal, Caitlin, who is now 10 months old, seems to be developing normally . Ms Kellie-Jones, right, wants to raise £16,000 for additional cooling machines to help save other babies . Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'My mum was a neonatal nurse for many years and I often visited her at work and would see all of these babies in their little incubators and see families in and out visiting their babies, but I never imagined it would be me. Ms Kellie-Jones said the next important stage is whether she will be able to walk and talk normally . 'We couldn't look to the days ahead and my mum told me to take lots of pictures. I knew what they were all trying to tell me, everyone thought she wouldn't make it. 'I didn't move from her side for hours. I had the doctors and nurses tell me the worst case scenario so I could prepare myself, but it was very upsetting to hear she might not make it. 'Paul was the opposite, he wanted to know the best possible outcome. 'We were lucky that we were able to get Caitlin on one of the machines, otherwise we might not have been bringing her home.' Caitlin was born and treated at Royal Preston Hospital, where there are only two cooling machines available. Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'We are extremely lucky that the last cooling machine was available for our daughter that day. 'I'm trying to raise money now for two cerebral function machines for the hospital, which monitor brain activity for any signs of brain damage, and, if I raise enough, another cooling machine for the neonatal unit. 'My target is to raise at least £16,000. 'Her brother Dylan, 10, is doing a sponsored bike ride with his granddad to help too. 'At his age he could have thought what happened to Caitlin was normal, but he came to see her every night and loves her to pieces.' Caitlin will need follow up appointments until she is two, but it is hoped she will make a full recovery. To donate go to: www.justgiving.com/CaitlinsCoolingCause .

Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life.

Adebayor will enter the final 12 months of his deal this summer and will be made available for loan or a permanent move.

    "input": "We're either guilty of it or we have a friend or family member who is a bandit for it: oversharing photos of our children on social media. While posting an image of your child smiling into the camera  covered in food may seem like a playful and cute move to you - it could be dangerous for your child in the long run. When it comes to uploading baby photos on social media, some feel like the more comments and  likes they get the better, but who is really looking at your photos and how far do they reach  on the net? Scroll down for video . Snap happy: We all know someone who overshares on social media - but could they be putting their kids' lives at risk? Just last week, Australian woman Jade Ruthven was lambasted on her social media account by her friends, who were so sick of her  constant updates about her baby daughter that they wrote her a scathing letter demanding she stop. The shocking letter, littered with expletives and exclamation marks told the mother that they were 'so over' the running commentary on her daughter's life. And while this may be a harsh reaction to her social obsession, social media expert Sarah-Jane Kurtini believes people need to more aware of their ramblings on the web. 'I think people just have this inbuilt need to share,' Ms Kuritini told Daily Mail Australia. Know your privacy settings . It is amazing how many parents leave on their Instagram location settings. Set your location settings to off if you do not want people to be able to figure out where you and your children live. Only share with people who care . Ask yourself if all the people you're sharing your photos with really want to see them and will they protect them in a way you would. Explore private social networks . Private social networks offer a secure way to share the pictures of your children with your family and friends. Don't take any digital photos . Ultimately the only way to be 100 per cent sure that you don't  have a digital footprint is not to have any digital photos taken but this isn't a road the vast majority of people want to go down. 'In a lot of cases it probably is fine but when you’re giving away exactly where your family life is taking place, there's a risk and it’s probably more sensible not to do it. 'People have started to be less self-aware and when everything happens they put it online. What they don’t think about is who they’re sharing it with.' While Ms Kurtini said that she understands why people can get fed up of people oversharing their kids' lives on social media sites, she was disturbed at the letter Ms Ruthven received from her so-called friends. 'Everyone came out in support of her which they should have done because bullying shouldn't be tolerated and that letter was horrific,' she said. Too many posts: Jade Ruthven, 33, pictured with Addison, has been sharing endless pictures and statuses about her baby daughter on Facebook . 'No one has come out and said that the limit is one baby photo a week or one a month, but everyone seems to know when someone has stepped over the mark.' The entrepreneur said it's hard for people to know where the line stops when it comes to posting personal details online. While a person may thrive off 'checking in' at the city's fanciest restaurant or showing friends what they're missing at the local pub, they can't treat their children's photos in the same way and should not look for the same social validation. 'One of the scary things about social media is how it makes you check yourself the whole time and second guess whether people will receive it well and it can make new mums quite anxious,' Ms Kurtini said. Harsh words: The letter was sent to an 'baby spamming' mother after the author got fed up with the amount of pictures and statuses she was writing on Facebook about her child - and it has now been shared worldwide . 'As soon as your friends like it you're just putting it into a new feed and it’s not clear where they’re going.' Ms Kurtini, who is the co-founder of Tinybeans, a private social media network for families said that although parents are worried about what the dangers of sharing on social media are, they choose to ignore the warnings. In a recent survey of social media awareness, conducted by the University of Michigan, over 74 per cent of respondents claimed they had doubts about posting baby images on the web, however they followed the crowd and did it anyway. Worryingly, 51 per cent of parents offer up personal information alongside their photos that could identify a child's location and 27 per cent have shared inappropriate pictures of their baby. They also found that more than half of mothers and one-third of fathers discuss child health and parenting on social media - and nearly three quarters of parents saying social media makes them feel less alone. 'A thing we always say is to share with those who care and don’t waste your precious family moments on people who don’t want to see them,' she said. Social validation: Nearly 70 percent of parents said they use social media to get advice from other more experienced parents and 62 % said it helped them worry less . 'The people I share with would never share them on and would protect them as much as I would. Ms Kurtini believes the message has yet to sink in with parents who continually post inappropriate snaps on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and even tag their location in the photos. Ms Kurtini believes enabling the geographical location to appear on the picture is the most worrying trend of them all. A recent study found when sharing parenting advice on social media, common topics included : . Getting kids to sleep (28%) Nutrition and eating tips (26%) Discipline (19%) Daycare/preschool (17%) Behaviour problems (13%) 'The scary thing is that they don’t know it’s happening,' she said. 'I know my privacy setting so I know that level of comfort with what I'm going to share but it looks like people don't. Especially on photo-sharing site Instagram, doting parents are sometimes inadvertently declaring their whereabouts and over time it can become clear exactly where they live. Ms Kurtini said she has spoken to mummy bloggers and celebrities who are horrified to learn that their photos can be tracked back to their home address just by the switch of one button. 'If you leave your location settings on, there’s a location tag and you can hit it and the majority of people add their photos at home so you can pretty much guess where they live,' she said. 'It terrifies me. 'I keep seeing people doing it and I want to email them saying stop it, especially high profile people.' Stories of oversharing gone wrong have been rampant in the news, with one of the most extreme examples including a phenomenon called 'digital kidnapping' reported on earlier this year. Parents were shocked to learn that strangers were 'stealing' their kids' online photos and re-sharing them as if the children were their own. Sand selfie: Despite parents being concerned over their privacy settings on social media sites, they continue to post photos online, sometimes giving away their geographical location . In other cases, children's photos have become the target of cruel jokes and cyber bullying. Among the most notorious cases in recent years was that of a Facebook group that made fun of 'ugly' babies. 'Many people are often lulled into a false sense of security thanks to the familiarity of social media and don't realise that the images or stories they post of their children may in fact be shared with a broader audience,' Ms Kurtini said. 'Parents need to approach their child's digital footprint mindfully.' The best way to do this is to know your privacy settings inside out. In many instances, it can take only a matter of mere seconds to deduce the road someone lives on from their social media post. Other precautions to take are to only share your snaps with people you trust and use a personal, private social media network.",

The 2012 Tour de France winner is quitting the team in order to ride for his own squad, 'Wiggins', before a return to the track ahead of the Rio Olympics, and wanted to sign off from what he called a 'golden era' with a win in one of the sport's most prestigious races. But it was not to be as Germany's John Degenkolb produced the perfect race to cross the line first at the end of a gruelling 151-mile trek which took in 27 tortuous cobbled spells. Bradley Wiggins sits on the floor after failing to win his final race with Team Sky in the Parsi-Roubaix . Wiggins left everything on the road as he attempted to bow out in glorious fashion, but was unable to hold on . German John Degenkolb celebrates as he crosses the line, winning the race ahead of Wiggins in 18th . Wiggins did his best, breaking away with 32 kilometres left to shake things up at the head of the peloton, while he also made a late push, but in the end he had to settle for a place down the line in 18th as Degenkolb took the glory. In the process he became the first rider to take first in the Milan San Remo and Paris-Roubaix in the same year since Sean Kelly back in 1986. One of the sport's classic races, the one-day slog did not fail to disappoint, but the drama almost got out of hand at one stage as some of the riders had a lucky escape when a train sped through the tracks they were due to cross. Some of the field slipped across despite the safety barriers being down, while others were held at the gate before being able to resume. Degenkolb celebrates his win alongside Zdenek Stybar (left) and Greg van Avermaet (right) Wiggins led a breakaway with 32 kilometres remaining, but was unable to maintain his lead to win . After that interlude the drama returned to the saddle, although Sky's in-form Geraint Thomas was unable to play a part. Amongst the early front-runners he was unseated when he ran into a curb, while he also suffered injuries on the way which eventually reduced him to a participant. For Wiggins it was always going to be a case of leaving nothing on the road ahead of his next phase, which is to include a ride at the Tour de Yorkshire. He first made himself known in the race when he moved to the head of the peloton with 45 kilometres to go and, with 32 remaining he ditched the pack in a bid to reel in the leaders. The peloton drew him back but his intent was clear and he held pace with them until Greg van Avermaet and Yves Lampaert went for it on their own. Luke Rowe (right) finished ahead of Wiggins in the end, coming in eighth, Team Sky's best performance . The pair were joined by Degenkolb and then Zdenek Stybar and at this point it was clear Wiggins' race was run. He found some extra power to go it alone again but the top prize was no longer on the table for him and he was amongst the rest as Degenkolb won the race in two laps of the Roubaix Velodrome. In the end Luke Rowe was Sky's first man home in eighth, while Stybar and Van Avermaet took second and third respectively.",

But on Thursday night, to celebrate the fifth anniversary of her fight against childhood obesity, Michelle Obama once again busted some moves, this time on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In a segment called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2, the pair partnered up once again to show off some self-made maneuvers to a cover of I Like The Way You Move. It was a follow-up routine to a similar jaunt they did in 2013, in an attempt to inspire parents to get out and get moving with their kids. Lets disco: Michelle Obama strutted her stuff on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night, in a follow-up routine to one they first did in 2013 . OMG: Called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2, the pair  pulled some embarrassing 'mom moves' Join in: First Lady Michelle Obama and Jimmy Fallon took it to the dance floor again during her appearance on The Tonight Show on Thursday night . Oh no you didn't: At the end of the routine, Fallon pulled a goofy move he called the 'Barack Obama' Take this: But Michelle came back kicking, showing off an equally-awful jive called the 'Jimmy Fallon' In dancing up a storm, the two demonstrated some jives they called 'You Go Girl' and 'Oh My God, I Didn't Know You Were Coming Here!' But when Fallon pulled a silly move he called the 'Barack Obama', Michelle obviously hit back with a terrible take on Fallon himself. The Let's Move! Initiative encourages people to eat better, be more active and healthier. It was first launched in February 2010. During a sit-down with Fallon, Michelle spoke of what she's achieved in the last five years, and her love of music. 'I have an iPod,' she said. 'I usually just put my earphones in in the car. I’m always listening to music. That’s the way I kind of settle myself.' Initiative: Lets Move! is an anti-childhood obesity campaign that Michelle first launched in 2010 . However music isn't something she necessarily shares with her daughters,  Malia, 17, and Sasha, 14. 'Now I’m at the stage where my kids are introducing me to music and they’re like, ''You don’t wanna hear this mom - the language is too bad'',' she said. 'Well, what are you doing listening to it?' On March 16, Michelle busted some similar moves with Ellen DeGeneres, dancing in a much more choreographed segment to Uptown Funk. Healthy eating: Michelle Obama told Jimmy Fallon that she gets her daughters to eat vegetables by having a 'no treat' rule in the house if they choose not to eat healthy . Give me broccoli!: Michelle Obama told Jimmy Fallon that the no treat rule worked and her daughters asked for her to give them the broccoli . The US First Lady revealed that she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to the same song on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year. In addition to breaking it down on stage, Michelle Obama told Fallon how she gets her teenagers to eat healthy food. Obama said she has a 'no treat'  rule in her house if her daughters Sasha and Malia don't eat their vegetables. If the girls tell her their 'full' because they don't want  to eat the vegetables in front of them, there are no substitute meals if they become hungry later. 'After a couple of days of starvation, it’s like, ‘gimme the broccoli,’ she joked . Fallon told FLOTUS that he too has a method of getting child to eat healthy but his method is a lot sneakier than hers. 'I’m trying to sneak vegetables into anything, but there is a sneaky way to do it,' Fallon said of giving his two young daughters vegetables. 'I hide it in brownies,' he said.

The Chancellor claimed the 'one hour' a week he had allowed himself off each week during the election campaign was to watch the programme, starring Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson. He vowed to maintain tax relief on big TV productions which have encouraged the makers of Poldark and other series to choose the UK. Scroll down for video . Mr Osborne admitted that he was secretly addicted to hit BBC series Poldark, starring Aidan Turner . The Chancellor said the television show was a 'fantastic advert for Britain' and particularly Cornwall . 'I haven't seen the original series from the 70s, so it's all new. It's a fantastic advert for Britain and British talent – and also for Cornwall,' the Chancellor told the Daily Mail. 'I am sure many visitors will flock to Cornwall from around the world when they see these wonderful scenes of Poldark riding along the cliffs. 'It has been the one hour off during the whole of this campaign. I keep my 9pm on a Sunday clear for that. It's fantastic. It's the very best of British television.' Asked whether he was was on 'team Demelza' or 'team Elizabeth', the Chancellor confessed: 'I'm bit of a Demelza fan, it has to be said.' Mr Osborne confessed to a crush on its female lead character Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson . Mr Osborne said he was 'delighted' that the series had been shot in Britain. 'Frankly, under the tax regime I inherited a production like this would have gone somewhere else in Europe, like Ireland or on the Continent,' he said. 'I said I wanted the best TV done in this country. It's about creating jobs. I think this series is going to run and run.' It is understood that tax credits introduced by the Treasury to encourage programme-makers to choose the UK has been worth more than £2 million to Mammoth Screen, the production company behind Poldark. Sources close to the company say that without the incentive, it would have been filmed in Ireland. Instead, it is going back to Cornwall for a second series. Poldark has attracted as many as seven million viewers, helping BBC1 to its highest ratings share for the first quarter of the year in a decade.",

Father-of-two Shiraz Nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15-foot flames shot out of the manhole just seconds after he had walked over it in a busy street in the West Midlands. The 36-year-old had been on his way to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him. Flames as high as 15ft tall erupted from a manhole in the West Midlands just moments after a pedestrian had walked over it . Shiraz Nawaz, 36, said he felt lucky to be alive after he narrowly missed being burnt by flames shooting out of the manhole . As he turned around he noticed the charred ground and watched on as thick black smoke began billowing from the manhole. The smoke was followed by a huge blast of flame which shot out 15-foot of the ground on the pedestrian walkway. Further bursts of flame and thick black plumes of smoke were to follow. Despite his shock,  the building contractor was able to grab his phone in time to film the terrifying incident. 'Had it literally been a few seconds earlier I would have been walking right over it,' said a shaken Mr Shiraz. Mr Nawaz said he had been walking to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him and noticed the blackened cover . As he watched on in shock, thick black smoke began to escape from the manhole in the busy street in Shirley, Solihull . 'I'm so lucky I didn't get burned.  I think I used up one of my lives right there. 'I've never seen anything like it, and I have been in the building trade.' Miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident, thanks to Mr Shiraz who had evacuated the nearby takeaway. The former gas engineer told the staff to turn off the gas supply and also rang the fire service after the incident in the busy Stratford Road, Shirley, Solihull. Firefighters extinguished the blaze, which they said was caused by a fire in an underground link box - which distributes electricity - below the manhole. Neighbouring properties had to be evacuated and many others lost power for several hours as crews tackled the electrical fire which was thought to have started accidentally. Shiraz, who now fits kitchens and bathrooms, said: 'To think that I had just walked over that. 'The flames kept shooting up - maybe five or six times. The smoke was followed by a quick blast of flame which shot out of the manhole on the pedestrian walkway . Flames shot up to a startling 15-foot high and could be reaching the top of the nearby shop and take away fronts . 'I'm a building contractor so I knew that when I heard the noises it was something to do with electrics. It was like a buzzing. 'I knew what it was but I didn't expect flames to come shooting out straight away or anything like that. Shiraz was walking from his home to the Dixie Chicken shop around the corner from his home when he saw the flames at around 7pm on Monday. 'I got my phone out because I heard the actual noise and I think I saw a flash,' he said. 'I think I managed to get it on film just as the first real flames came up. 'It looked like it was coming from a manhole cover. It was quite shocking. 'I told the guys in the shop to switch off the gas and get everyone out. I told them to stop any unassuming person from walking down the road while I stayed on the other side. Flames were followed by more plumes of dark smoke continued to billow up out of the charred ground reaching several feet high . Miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident after Shiraz evacuated the nearby takeaway, told them to turn off their gas supply, and called the fire service . 'The guy in the shop grabbed me a couple of burgers after everything, so I guess it had a happy ending.' A spokesman for West Midlands Fire Service said: 'We had a number of calls about about it - probably five or six, maybe a couple more. 'It involved a fire in an underground electrical link box. The electrical supply was isolated by Western Power. 'Power was isolated to surrounding homes and premises for four hours. 'Three people were evacuated from one of the properties. 'We used a CO2 extinguisher and a hose real with foam, because it was an electrical fire. It was accidental.' Western Power Distribution workers were later seen repairing the man hole cover in Shirley, Solihull . The area had been evacuated and blocked off as Western Power Distribution employees worked to fix the underground link box . Incredibly no-one was hurt in the incident and quick-thinking Shiraz managed to grab his phone in time to take a film of the astonishing flames .",

    "input": "The moon is set to turn a sinister-looking blood red this Easter weekend. The total lunar eclipse will transform the moon on Saturday night and will be visible in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. According to one US pastor, the event was predicted in the Bible and hints at an imminent world-changing event, but Nasa is quick to point out that the change in hue is entirely harmless. Scroll down for video . Saturday’s total lunar eclipse, which will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange, will be visible in in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. A previous total lunar eclipse as seen from Mexico city on December 21, 2010 is pictured . The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Pastor John Hagee told The Mirror that the sight suggests a world-changing event will take place, as predicted in the Bible. According to the King James Bible: ‘The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.’ Mr Hagee, who has written a book on the Tetrad called ‘Four Blood Moons’, said that because the Blood Moon falls on Easter Weekend, it’s a sign that 'something dramatic will happen which will change the whole world'. The event is called a Tetrad since it involves four successive total blood red lunar eclipses each followed by six full moons. ‘I believe we're going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world,' he said. The strange celestial sight, which will be visible in the US, was predicted in the Bible and could hint at a world-changing event, such as the return of Christ, according to one pastor. This image shows the red moon over a church in LA during the last blood moon in October last year . A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. There are numerous mentions of blood moons in the Bible, such as in the Book of Joel, chapter two, which says the 'Day of the Lord will be as when the sun refuses to shine' and in Luke, which hints that signs in the sun, moon and stars will tell of the second coming. While the Bible prophesises blood moons, it does not give a timeline of when the significant event will happen. Mr Hagee said: ‘It just says “when you see these signs” - and four blood moons is a very significant one - '”the end of this age is coming.”’ While the event may be of huge religious significance to some people, for others it will simply be a chance to see something beautiful light up the night sky. The lunar eclipse will occur when the moon passes behind the Earth, into its shadow. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. This gives rise to its ‘blood red’ appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon. This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it . Blood moons  - an image from the last event is shown-  are predicted in the Bible. According to the King James Bible: ‘The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes’ Two of the four blood moons have already occured. The first happened on April 15, 2014 and the second on October 8, 2014. The third blood moon will begin on Saturday April 4, 2015 . The last will happen on September 28, 2015 . ‘During the eclipse, the moon often looks reddish because sunlight has passed through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out most of its blue light,’ Nasa said. ‘This eerie, harmless effect has earned the tongue-in-cheek nickname “blood moon”’ The ‘Tetrad’ of four alignments within two years, happens just a few times in every 2,000 years. Sky watchers will have to be quick to catch this installment because Nasa predicts the total eclipse will last for just five minutes in the US. The partial phases will be visible on April 4 just before the sun rises in the US, Space.com reported. People living on the West Coast of America will see the moon turn red from 7.58am (11.58 GMT), while sky watchers in Australia, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia will see the total phases for up 12 minutes, from 7.54am EDT.

Other-worldly: The incredible view from the Spanish Canary Island of Tenerife . Illuminating: The moon glows orange, as seen from Milwaukee in the USA . Saturday’s total lunar eclipse, which will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange, will be visible in in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. In this image the last blood moon is situated high above Sydney . The 'Tetrad,' cycle began in April last year. It involves a series of four dark red 'blood moons.' At the end of the cycle in September 2015, some believe the end of the world will happen . The final blood moon of the Tetrad will occur on September 28 and there will be nine sets of them in the 21st century. But Nasa has previously said that the Tetrad only happened three times in the past 500 years. From 1600 to 1900, for example, there were none at all. According to Mr Hagee, each time the Tetrad has happened during that time, there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it. In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded. And the most recent one, in 1967, happened during the Six-Day War between Arabs and Israelis. Mr Hagee said that the first of the Tetrad blood moons happened on April 15, right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. The second, on October 8, occured during the Feast of the Tabernacle. The third, this Saturday is also occurring during Passover and on Easter weekend. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, during the Feast of the Tabernacles. The final blood moon of the Tetrad will occur on September 28 and there will be nine sets of them in the 21st century.The moon is seen glowing red and partially obscured in shadow as it rises during a total lunar eclipse from Kathmandu, Nepal in October .",

    "input": "Rangers boss Stuart McCall has delivered a sharp rebuke to David Templeton after the winger criticised the training-ground methods deployed by the manager's predecessors, Ally McCoist and Kenny McDowall. Former Hearts star Templeton claimed last week that McCall had introduced a brand of coaching and tactical preparation which had been lacking under the previous management. But McCall, who is busy transforming the club on the pitch after three successive wins in the Championship, was less than impressed by the player's comments and hinted that they may have been motivated by the player's lack of game time under McCoist and McDowall. Rangers winger David Templeton spoke out about his former managers Ally McCoist and Kenny McDowall . 'David made an error,' said the ex-Rangers midfielder. 'He was out of the frame a wee bit under Kenny and Ally. 'But he knows we are not here to criticise what went on before, because the players were part of that. All we are concentrating on is the here and now.' McCall also had words of warning for skipper Lee McCulloch, claiming his red card against Hearts could cost him his place in the Ibrox line-up. The defender has been given a two-match ban - starting with Queen of the South at Palmerston on Thursday - after being sent off on Sunday. The Light Blues captain put his elbow into the face of Jambos striker Osman Sow as the pair jumped for a high ball. McCall, whose team clung on for a vital 2-1 win after playing 50 minutes a man down, had been happy with McCulloch's displays until that point. But the interim Rangers manager has now warned the former Scotland cap he is not 'undroppable'. He said: 'Lee made a poor decision. I understand why he did it but it was a blatant red card. He led with his elbow and it was wrong - but he knows he was wrong. 'He has got to take his punishment and move on now. He has got a two-game ban - whether he gets back in the team thereafter we will see. Lee McCulloch has been warned he could lose his place in the starting XI after being sent off against Hearts . 'Since I've been at the club he has done fine. He's been good in the dressing room and his performances have been good. 'If whoever comes in over the next two games does really well, then he might not get back in. 'He's not undroppable, no, but at this moment in time with the games we have played he has done nothing to merit being dropped.' Off the field, Dave King now hopes to get the SFA's blessing to take over as chairman after judges at the Court of Session approved his boardroom bid. But with 12 first-team players out of contract at the end of this season, McCall has warned his squad they may have to wait for new deals. He said: 'I don't think it will be too long before Dave becomes chairman of the club, so that is another positive move. 'I'm just concentrating on the football. I've spoken to a couple of directors about things but we have five games in 14 days so I'm just focusing on that. 'As for contracts, that can only be sorted when the club knows what league it's going to be playing in next season, so that is the key.' The weekend victory over Hearts moved Rangers back into the box seat for the promotion play-offs. Rangers boss Stuart McCall has led his team to three consecutive victories in the Scottish Championship . But that now leaves ex-Motherwell boss McCall facing the 'nightmare' scenario that he could come up against his former Fir Park troops. Motherwell's 5-0 victory over basement boys St Mirren has all but spared them from the automatic relegation spot but Ian Baraclough's team could yet be made to scrap for their Premiership place against Rangers in the play-off final. 'It's not looking likely at all because Motherwell are not going to finish in the bottom two - I hope,' said McCall. 'First and foremost we have to do our job and get in the play-offs. 'But I said when Motherwell signed Scott McDonald that I believed - and I still do - that they would have enough to get out of trouble.' Before that, though, McCall must continue to rack up the wins, starting with Thursday's trip to Dumfries. Rangers lost 2-0 on their last visit in December - just hours after it was revealed McCoist was stepping down as boss. 'I'm still aghast because I've just watched a video of the second half,' said McCall. 'I haven't showed the players because I think they know they were not in a good place at that time.

The fast food giant has caused fury after installing metal studs outside its branch in Leeds city centre, which critics say are there to stop people  sleeping rough. McDonald's has defended the use of the spikes, claiming they were installed two years ago in an attempt to stop anti-social behaviour, not target the homeless. Uproar: A petition has been started to get the spikes removed from outside this Leeds McDonald's and 70,000 have backed the campaign . But critics say they have been put in because they are uncomfortable to sleep on and installed on areas which used to be benches. Isobella DeMartino set up the petition to have them removed and has received support from across the globe. Row: Critics say the spikes were installed to target the homeless but McDonald's say it is only about anti-social behaviour . 'Anti-homeless spikes show complete disregard and lack of respect for homeless people who struggle every day,' she said. 'Spikes have been installed, presumably to prevent people sleeping there. 'The fact that the spikes exist shows how little people care about homeless people.' She added: 'Every time I'm in Leeds I see many ignore homeless people, not even bothering to smile at them let alone try to help them or give charity. I cannot imagine how painful and lonely it must be to be homeless. 'They deserve our attention and care, this issue cannot be ignored.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's said: 'The studs in question are not an 'anti- homeless' measure, as has been suggested. 'They have been in place for around two years and were introduced Following discussions with the police, in response to issues we were experiencing with antisocial behaviour. 'We welcome all customers through our doors and it is inaccurate to suggest a measure taken in response to tackling antisocial behaviour, is an attempt to deter homeless people.'",

However, Metropolitan Police have confirmed that the Italian and a 31-year-old woman also held at the scene, were released after being interviewed. Andrea Dossena (scoring against Real Madrid) will face no further action after being accused of shoplifting . Dossena, whose crowning moment for Liverpool came when he scored the winner against Real Madrid in the Champions League, last turned out for the relegation-fighting Os on April 14 in a 1-0 home loss to Doncaster Rovers. He also netted four days after that strike against Real back in March 2009, lobbing Edwin van der Sar away at Manchester United in a 4-1 win. Dossena, whose signing was seen as something of a coup for Orient, earned around £40,000-a-week at Anfield. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'A 33-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman who were arrested on suspicion of shoplifting were advised on April 10 that they would face no further action.'

A large crowd erupted in cheers as Pemba Tamang was carried out on a stretcher. He was wearing a New York shirt and a blue neck brace, was blanketed by dust and had the look of a deer in the headlights. His rescuer, Inspector Lakshman Basnet of the Nepalese Armed Police Force, said Tamang was responsive and showed no apparent signs of serious injury. He was given an IV drip and rushed from the Gongapur area to a temporary emergency hospital run by an Israeli aid team. The Nepalese rescuers had been working for five hours to locate Tamang after they heard his voice coming from under the debris. Also Thursday, a U.S. special operations forces team rescued 30 people, including three Americans, by helicopter from an area of Nepal called Bamboo Village, according to the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. The group was trapped in the village and living in a makeshift shelter, Ambassador Peter Bodde said. The families had contacted the U.S. government to let officials know where their relatives were stuck, he said. They had no other way to get out of the area, Bodde said. An American disaster response team was also involved in the rescue of the 15 year old boy. The team was at a nearby damaged bus station when it got word that someone might be alive. Andrew Olvera, the head of the U.S. team, said his men rushed over with search dogs and equipment ranging from breaching tools to sophisticated cameras that can probe under the rubble. He said the operation carried enormous risk, as chunks of the collapsed building hung precariously on rebar. Entire floors of what used to be people's homes were visible -- ceiling fans and beds still draped with cotton sheets. It was a mountain of loss and sorrow. \"It's dangerous, but it's what we do,\" said Olvera, who has a daughter and twin 11-year-old boys. \"It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we will risk almost everything. \"The way the building is, it's definitely a miracle,\" he said. Tamang cried for water in a muffled voice. He had been buried for five days under a building that pancaked. He dodged death because of a motorcycle that shielded him from the pressure of the concrete and steel, according to Basnet. And, Basnet said, he \"survived by good faith.\" Dennis Bautista, who went down to where Tamang was buried to administer medical aid, called the rescue amazing. \"It feels good to be able to help out. I can't imagine what he went through,\" Bautista said. \"He is a brave young man.\" Basnet said once he got closer to Tamang, he tried to reassure him that he would be OK. \"I gave him water and talked to him regularly,\" Basnet said. After Tamang was rushed to the hospital, the US Agency for International Development team continued the search. The possibility remained that someone else might have survived, like Tamang. Other search and rescue teams continued to scour through Kathmandu's rubble Thursday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities. Another 72 people were reported dead in India and 25 in China. In Nepal, 19 of the deaths occurred on Mount Everest, where the quake triggered deadly avalanches. Despite the disaster, Nepali authorities plans to reopen routes up the mountain as soon as next week. Teams are clearing paths and and rebuilding ladders, Tourism Ministry spokesman Krishna Sapkota told CNN on Thursday. Officials are encouraging people who have already received permission to climb this season to go ahead with their plans. As the chances dimmed for finding people alive in the wreckage left by the quake across Nepal, Tamang's rescue boosted hopes for all those who still have loved ones and friends missing. Other people have been saved from under collapsed buildings in previous days, including a 27-year-old man on Tuesday and a 4-month-old boy on Sunday. The Nepali military also released a photo of a dust-caked 11-year-old girl who they said was rescued Wednesday after 90 hours under the rubble. The rescuers, meanwhile, have no intention of giving up looking for more. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Olvera said, revised the benchmark for what was thought possible for survival. A man there was miraculously pulled from the rubble after 27 long days. 360-degree view of earthquake zone . CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.",

Riot of colour: The Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year . Superstition: People travel from nearby towns to join the Net Boat Fair. Other Water Temple Fairs are held around Chinese New Year. Fishermen from the area take their boats out for show, hoping for good fortune and blessing . Extravagance: An aerial view of the 2015 China Jiangnan Net Boat Fair which commemorates an ancient hero . Starting on different dates in the western calendar, the fair happens annually according to the Chinese Lunar calendar. This year, it began yesterday and the celebrations are expected to last three to seven days, with festivities sometimes being extended to a month long. One of the highlights of the carnival is the Net Boat Fair which showcases the unique culture of Jiangnan water people. One of the most anticipated performances is the 'tie the perfume to your skin' which sees performers attach metal hooks to their forearms. On the other side of the hook hangs a censer containing incense or sometimes even heavy anchors with flowers in them to mask the natural smell of the fishing town. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing . The traditional local folklore carnival pays homage to Liu Chengzhong, a figure who led people in annihilating locusts in the Yuan Dynasty . Tradition: Fishermen and their families dress up in traditional clothes. About 50 different folklore groups and nearly two thousand people will be joining the celebrations. It will be the biggest Net Boat Fair in 60 years . The Fair commemorates General Lui Chengzhong, a hero in the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), who successfully eliminated pests during a massive drought. When the Yuan Dynasty came to an end, General Lui killed himself by jumping in the river as an act of loyalty to the Yuan emperor. The locals built the Lui King temple for him and celebrated his heroic acts. Mr Li, one of the participants, told Jia Xing Ping Dao: 'I am the sixth generation to come to this temple fair. 'My great-grandfather once said the celebrations were even more extravagant than what we have now. 'We want to pray for safety and for the Gods to give us proper weather next year.' Music and beats: Little drums are used to scare away angry spirits. This event was listed as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in China in 2011, along with Chinese abacus, an ancient calculator . Cultural heritage: Fishermen prepare shrine offerings, including food, wine, pork, fruit and snacks. An elaborate ritual will be performed on the boats to give thanks to the Gods and the ancestors . The Net Boat Fair has already been included in the list of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage. One of the most important agenda this year is giving out the 'folklore religion activity' certificate to the Liu King temple. Jiangnan Mayor Liang Bokai sauid: 'This marks the first certificate of its kind. It is a massive step for the preservation, promotion and legacy of this folklore religion in the Liu King temple. 'We will further promote our local customs and culture and combine it with tourism in order to put out a new image.' Jiangnan folklore: 'Stepping on whites boats' is a custom for fishermen. Their boats are known to be very unstable because of the exceptionally long frame. Fishermen remodel the boats with a wooden see-saw in the middle. Two people stands on the edge of both sides and jump to make the boat go forward . Tourism: It is a very popular tourist attraction as well. Vendors and shopkeepers appeal their products to passers-by, participants gather for pictures and others pray for blessings .",

Rodrigo Gularte, 42, asked 'Am I being executed?' as he was being chained up to be transported to the jungle clearing on Nusakambangan island where he and seven other death row inmates were killed by firing squad in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Irish priest appointed to be Gularte's spiritual advisor in his final hours said he talked to Gularte for an hour and a half late on Tuesday night to prepare him for the executions, but the convicted drug trafficker was confused about his fate and complained about hearing voices.

All eight men refused to wear blindfolds, choosing instead to face their executioners. Father Burrows said once the men were tied up he was allowed to go and speak to Gularte again, who did not become hysterical but spoke in protest of his imminent death. 'I talked to him and he said \"This is not right, I made one small mistake and I shouldn't be having to die for it,\"' he said. 'He was annoyed more than anything else because he's a very soft spoken, quiet and sensitive man.' Gularte was arrested in 2004 on arrival at Jakarta airport with about six kilograms (13 pounds) of cocaine hidden in several surfboards. He was sentenced to death by the Tangerang District Court in February 2005, and spent seven of his 11 years in prison on Nusakambangan. Gularte's family tried without success to obtain clemency for him, saying doctors have classed him as paranoid schizophrenic. Under Indonesian law, a mental health disease can provide for clemency in death penalty cases. Jakarta twice turned down appeals for clemency and the Indonesian authorities told the Gularte family only a government doctor's diagnosis would be considered for Rodrigo's possible reprieve.

Gularte's devastated family always insisted he was mentally ill and fell prey to drugs in his teens and to a Brazilian drug cartel in his early thirties. He was so deluded that when he was arrested he told Indonesian police his two fellow couriers had nothing to do with the scheme. They were sent home. A year later, he was sentenced to death. In an interview with Daily Mail Australia in February, when Gularte's family still had hope he might be spared, his cousin Marlise Gularte de Cavalho said the 42-year-old would tell his family he didn't believe that he would be executed during prison visits. He insisted a manned satellite over Nusakambangan was stalking him and voices in his head told him he wouldn't be executed because 'the voices say the death penalty has been abolished'.

    "input": "Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them. The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion bid. So far, everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi-final play-off slot. Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season, though he may not be at Rangers . But with 12 players out of contract, McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals. He said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when... Even if I'm not here, if I'm getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager, then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year. 'It's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1, 'Oh we need to get into action'. 'No, there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff, we think will be good for next season, regardless of what league we are in. 'It would be slightly naive [if we were not doing that]. If I'm in charge or not, I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here.' McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position . Rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation. The club's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad. But McCall revealed the club's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before. 'I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people,' said the former Motherwell boss. 'I don't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet. 'I don't think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere. Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years . 'But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place. 'Having said that, I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with [online service] Wyscout. When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell, that was after I'd seen a clip of him on YouTube. I sold him for £350,000 after signing him for nothing. That was great. 'So you can still do your own background work. Personally I would always like to see the player myself. I've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it. 'So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are, not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe.' McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan's Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin. And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday's match with Falkirk. McCall's side are still in line for promotion, sitting in the play-off positions in the Scottish Championship . Peter Houston's Bairns - five points behind fourth-placed Queen of the South with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play-offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers. He said: 'Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don't know what to expect. 'It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play-offs so I don't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free. 'They don't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes. We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best.'",

Umma, 25, was forced to marry a foreign fighter. She said did not see him very much as he was often on the front line. 'Most of the time I would stay at my parents’ house because he wasn't around. He behaved normally, he would come home for two or three days and then go back to fight,' she said, adding that she did not love him. Now the pair, who are living in Turkey illegally, are scared they will be discovered by ISIS fighters who, they believe, are following them.

Above, other women from the brigade are pictured holding guns . It achieved notoriety last year after women who travelled to join the Islamic State's insurgency boasted of joining the police unit. They used social media to brag about doling out savage beatings and lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of sex slaves are believed to be imprisoned and raped daily. In the brigade's first manifesto, released in February, women are told to live a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle. It adds that their role should be primarily to remain 'hidden and veiled' and at the service of men, who are described as their masters. While it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS's leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women are treated. Last September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa. Her footage showed several gun-wielding French women who had left their home country to join ISIS (above) The women’s revelations come a day after a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya was released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the east of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', were lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others were filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. It followed another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film.",

    "input": "New York City cab drivers spend their entire work days eavesdropping on their customers conversations, so it's no surprise that many of them have learned a thing or two about love and relationships along the way. With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own – but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what’s best for the other person. If you’re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can’t do that, you’re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden – suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner’s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won’t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don’t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you’re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don’t do that.'",

Almond growers in California are at the centre of a row over water usage during one of the worst droughts in decades. The state, which supplies more than three-quarters of the world's $4.93billion(£3.3bn) almond market, is in its fourth year of drought. Scroll down for videos . Dry days: Homes with swimming pools are seen in the Palm Springs area, California, as the state enters its fourth year of severe drought . This has also seen local residents attack the bottled water industry, after it was revealed that several companies have been 'taking advantage of poor government oversight to deplete mountain streams and watersheds,' The Guardian reports. A campaign singles out Nestle as the main villain, after an investigation by a local newspaper found that the company has been sourcing water from some of the driest areas in the state using expired permits. An online petition demanding that the company seizes production of bottled water in California with immediate effect has garnered more than 150,000 signatures. Despite the ongoing drought,  almond growers, who require a gallon of water to produce a single nut, are still planting trees. The industry's growth is being driven by the public's clamour for a food with benefits for the heart, the bones and metabolism. Still going: Almond growers in California are at the centre of a row over water usage during one of the worst droughts in decades . Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain . A gardener works on a golf course in La Quinta, California, as residents campaign against the bottled drinks industry and almond growers in a bid to stop the drought . Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain. Unlike cows' milk, almond milk – which is made from ground nuts and water – has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy. David Cameron is said to be a fan, and Sainsbury's reported a 181 per cent sales increase in the milk last year. But in California, there is growing anger that while most people are facing water rations, the almond industry has been left to expand its orchards and guzzle all the water it wants. Tom Stokely, of the California Water Impact Network, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'There has been a huge expansion of almonds. As we speak, there are yet more almond orchards being planted. In many cases the farmers are planting them in areas of low water supply so groundwater is being over-drafted. 'They're doing it because there are such huge profits. Now they're asking the rest of us to give up our water so they can stay in business.' Unlike cows' milk, almond milk – which is made from ground nuts and water – has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy . But the almond industry insists it needs the resources. Brad Gleason, a grower in Fresno County, said: 'I'm proud to be a farmer of almonds. We produce something real and healthy that contributes mightily to the economy of California. 'Some of the old-timers still remember when this stretch of Fresno County belonged to the horned toad, jack rabbit and tumbleweed. Demonising us, and what we grow, is no way to meet the challenge. We're not the bad guys.' Governor Jerry Brown also defended his decision to exempt agriculture from the water consumption cap, saying: 'Agriculture is an important pillar of California.' Pineapple lovers are facing hefty hikes in the price of their favourite fruit, according to a report yesterday. Pineapple prices have soared to their highest level for almost three years as a result of poor weather in Costa Rica, which has led to plummeting supplies. Trade magazine The Grocer said that while retail prices of many fruit and vegetable lines had fallen over recent months, the average price of a loose pineapple in the biggest UK supermarkets has risen to $2.41(£1.61) – up from $2.21(£1.48) in March. Costa Rica is the world's biggest exporter of pineapples, accounting for 90 per cent of the global fresh supply, but recent cold and wet weather had hit this year's harvest.",

    "input": "Passengers on board a Virgin Atlantic flight from Las Vegas to Gatwick who endured a 33-hour delay have described the incident as 'excruciating' and 'an absolute nightmare.' Flight VS44 should have left  McCarran airport at 4.30pm local time on Easter Monday. But a series of delays meant the 403 passengers did not get away on their flight to Gatwick until early on Wednesday. The long delays were too much for some passengers who took to the airport floor to rest . A catalogue of events took place that saw passengers bound for London from Las Vegas delayed by over 33 hours . This shot was snapped by passenger Paul Glogiewicz; the passengers were eventually told there was a problem with the plane's rudder . And now, some passengers are considering legal action against Virgin. Jennifer Glogiewicz, who was travelling with husband Paul and celebrating her 40th birthday, told MailOnline Travel that they were shunted back and forth from the airport to the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel, only to find out each time that there were more delays. 'They just kept telling us the air con wasn't working and plane to warm to board. Then  later they said there was also a rudder issue,' said the mother of two from Bromley. 'The part needed was in the UK and that it would be flown in on tomorrow's inbound Vegas flight, then it would fitted and we would be flown home.' After being seated for two hours on the runway at the culmination of the 33-hour delays, the plane finally set off to the UK at 4am local time. 'We were very worried the entire flight hoping it had been fixed properly. 'Luckily it was a pleasant flight. Every announcement on board began with 'again we apologise'. 'We Landed at Gatwick and were given two letters and £20 per person to spend in M&S; a bit late if you ask me. 'The main point of all our complaints was the lack of communication and awful customer skills of the Virgin Vegas ground staff. The lack of proper communication made the whole thing an absolute nightmare.' Unbelievably some passengers remained in good spirits despite being forced to an unscheduled check-in at the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel . Passenger Charlie Nolan captured this photo of the plane after repairs had been halted because of the winds . Another passenger, Charlie Nolan, claimed that a Virgin employee who was updating the passengers over the tannoy lost his cool when the 400 passengers sarcastically clapped and whooped at the news that the engineers had decided to move the plane to a sheltered area to repair. The wind at the airport had meant the repairs could not be carried out quickly . Nolan told MailOnline Travel that 'another Virgin employee at the gate almost broke down in tears over the tannoy and that 'she claimed she had been working for 48 hours and wanted to go home to her children.' Banker Michael Jazanovich, 30, from Crouch End, north London, who was returning from a stag do, told London's Evening Standard: 'It was an absolute nightmare for everyone involved. The delays were unacceptable and excruciating as they were pushed back and back and people had to sleep in the airport. 'We are expecting a lot more (than €600). We have lost our time and had an awful experience. 'We deserve a lot more and, by taking a group action, we can work together to get this. We could share a lawyer, we are willing to take it as far as we need to.' They were given hotel accommodation on Monday evening but spent Tuesday night in the airport terminal. Mrs Glogiewicz added: 'I do feel Virgin should just refund everyone their flight cost and be done, not make us all claim. 'This ending has tarnished a great time away with my husband and made me wary of future travel.' Passengers were taken to the Tropicana Las Vegas on numerous times during the long flight delay . Stranded passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations over the eventual 33-hour delay . Virgin has said that eligible passengers would be getting EU compensation of €600 (circa £434) plus out-of-pocket expenses, but some are demanding much more. A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said: 'We always try our best to get things right for our customers and we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by the delay of flight VS44 from Las Vegas to London Gatwick on April 6. 'On this occasion, the initial delay was caused by a technical fault with the aircraft and the delay was then extended because of strong winds around the McCarran airport area which hampered our engineers carrying out the repairs. Over 400 passengers endured a nightmare delay to their journey back to the UK from the US . The Virgin Atlantic flight eventually took flight some 33 hours behind schedule after technical problems (file photo) Passengers explained how they had been shipped back and forth to the airport with no solution . 'All of our customers were provided with hotel accommodation and meals while they waited, and we will reimburse them for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 'In addition, we will be providing eligible customers with EU compensation to the equivalent of €600 per person. 'Customers should visit www.virginatlantic.com/euclaimapplication for advice, details of the claims process and to download an application form. 'Once we’ve received the completed claim form a dedicated customer relations team will issue payment as a priority.'",

But after liberating a nation to spend their money as they wish, Steve Webb has now urged people to take their time rather than make rash decisions. Yesterday the biggest pension reforms in a century were launched, allowing over-55s to cash in their pension pots rather than being forced to buy a fixed monthly income. But as Pensions Freedom Day finally arrived, the Government appealed for caution, perhaps fearing that some people will quickly exhaust their funds and be forced to rely on the State. Mr Webb said over-55s ‘don’t have to rush this’ and insisted there was ‘a case for waiting and seeing’. He said April 6 was the ‘starting gun’ and not a ‘deadline’, adding: ‘We want people to make informed choices. This isn’t a mad scramble rush to do something this morning.’ Asked about his flippant remark last year that people should be able to buy a Lamborghini with their pension, he admitted ‘you will pay a hell of a lot of tax’ if you do. While the first 25 per cent of any withdrawals from pensions are tax-free, savers will have to pay income tax on the remainder. Those who withdraw their pension in one go face hefty bills if they are pushed into a higher tax bracket. Official forecasts show that the Treasury is set to receive an additional £370million of income tax in the next year as a result of the changes. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron has a bit of lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota as they eat lunch in the garden with people who have benefited from tax and pension changes that came into force today . And documents published alongside the Budget suggest this could reach £3.8billion by 2020. Research by consumer group Which? shows that buying a £228,000 Lamborghini Aventador would incur a £126,000 tax bill if you withdrew the cash in one go – enough to buy a Porsche 911 Turbo. But a study by insurer Aegon found that a third of over-55s were unaware of the tax implications of withdrawing all their money at once. Spokesman Kate Smith said: ‘People could lose out on thousands of pounds of their hard-earned savings.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - who was out campaigning with the Energy  Secretary Ed Davey in Surbiton, London, today - has hailed the pensions reforms . And yesterday Dr Ros Altmann, the Government’s champion for older workers, warned that people who withdraw their cash could be hit with a ‘triple tax whammy’ – on their withdrawal, on any new investment and because the money no longer had tax-free status. She urged caution, and said that right now she would advise pensioners to ‘do nothing’. The new reforms will allow 2.1million over-55s to withdraw all or part of their funds rather than being required to buy an annuity. Studies show many will use at least part of their money to go on holiday, pay off debts, renovate their homes or help their family financially. However it could take time for people to get their hands on their pension pot. While all firms must allow people to take their entire lump sum, many will not allow partial withdrawals. This means many customers will have to switch companies, incurring exit fees and involving time-consuming paperwork. Michelle Cracknell, of the Pensions Advisory Service, said she would advise pensioners ‘not to book the cruise right now’. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable  if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can cash in their pensions and spend them  instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image)",

    "input": "(CNN)Robert Bates, 73, shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police. Bates was a reserve deputy sheriff, which allowed him to \"work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the Special Olympics and Tulsa State Fair,\" according to the Tulsa County Sheriff Office's website. But Bates wasn't limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled. He had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force, according to his lawyer.  On April 2, Bates thought he was going to use a Taser on Eric Harris, who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a Lugar pistol and then took off running. But Bates wasn't holding a Taser. He was holding his gun. He fired one shot and killed Harris. From a policing perspective, there wasn't even good reason to use a Taser against Harris. Cops were on scene. Harris wasn't getting the upper hand. He wasn't going anywhere. And despite what Bates would later claim, Harris was not running like a man with a gun. In fact, Harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband. What was Bates, an insurance company CEO, doing there in the first place? It certainly looks like Bates was given special access to \"real\" policing. Harris had given $2,500 to Sheriff Stanley Glanz's re-election campaign. He donated cars to the department. He gave equipment. So it would be noteworthy if Bates ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by \"sunglass cameras\" that he may have purchased for the department. A Tulsa police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies, many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police. \"That's not unusual at all,\" he told the Tulsa World. Maybe Bates could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything. But I doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force. He was too old to be policing the streets. Tulsa police said that Bates had served a year in 1964 as a police officer. Most police departments have mandatory retirement ages. Federal law-enforcement officers, for instance, retire at 57. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? Police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers. For one thing, it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free. But departments also know that you get what you pay for. What is the point of background checks, psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol? Some people are a little too eager to be police officers. These people perhaps buy a police-like car for their personal car. Maybe they put in a police light or two. Some have actually made car stops. Police departments hate cop impersonators (it's illegal, by the way) and try and weed them during the hiring process. You want workers who like the job, but not too much; there's a fine line between passion and fanaticism. That said, there are good volunteer police officers. New York City, for example, has auxiliary police. These officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities. They wear an NYPD uniform but do not carry a gun. Auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police. Volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling, and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized SWAT officers. An auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge. It can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job isn't for them before they are locked into a 20-year commitment. What happened in Tulsa County is a disgrace to police professionalism, and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs. That would be a mistake. Police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public. But a line does need to be drawn.",

    "input": "The creator of the best-selling Alex Rider spy novels has accused fellow children’s author David Walliams of dumbing-down fiction and failing to ‘challenge’ young readers. Anthony Horowitz said books by the comedian – who was the UK’s top-selling children’s author last year – are ‘witty and entertaining’ but nowhere near ambitious enough. The 59-year-old novelist and screenwriter singled out Walliams’ Gangsta Granny for criticism, as well as the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid books by author Jeff Kinney. Scroll down for video . Author Anthony Horowitz (pictured right) said books by comedian David Walliams (left) – who was the UK’s top-selling children’s author last year – are ‘witty and entertaining’ but nowhere near ambitious enough . He insisted that such writers should challenge their young readers and not be ‘afraid of powerful stories or serious ideas’. He suggested they should follow the example of authors such as John Green and ‘write up for children, not down to them’. Green’s book, The Fault In Our Stars, tells the story of two teenagers who fall in love while they are both dying of cancer, and was the top-selling title of 2014, with more than 870,000 copies sold. Horowitz, who is also the principal writer on the ITV period detective drama Foyle’s War, singled out Gangsta Granny, with its breaking-wind jokes and a character who perpetuates the myth that children ‘automatically dislike reading’. Writing in the Times Educational Supplement, he said he was troubled that children’s books ‘seem to have come full circle’. Walliams made over £7million in 2014 from book sales including The Boy in the Dress and Demon Dentist . He added: ‘To some extent, narrative fiction was reinvented by JK Rowling – it’s hard to believe that children weren’t challenged by books that stretched to 760 pages – and a phalanx of writers crested on her success: Michael Morpurgo, Philip Pullman, Jacqueline Wilson, Malorie Blackman, Eoin Colfer, Darren Shan... and me. 'Today it is Jeff Kinney and David Walliams who top the bestseller lists, with books that are witty and entertaining but nowhere near as ambitious.’ He added: ‘Speaking personally, I was a little sad when, in Walliams’ Gangsta Granny, we were told that among the old woman’s vices, which included dribbling and farting: “Her house was stuffed full of books and she was always trying to get Ben to read them, even though he loathed reading”.’ Horowitz said ‘the idea that children automatically dislike reading or that books belong to a more fusty, ancient generation is patently absurd’. His Alex Rider books, the first of which was published in 2000, have been ‘brightly re-jacketed’, and are ‘as popular as ever’. They have sold 19million copies in 30 different languages, he pointed out. Horowitz said: ‘Quite recently, I addressed an audience of largely unpublished writers in New York and I stand by the advice that I gave them. ‘Write up for children, not down to them. We don’t need to be afraid of powerful stories or serious ideas. The audience is there.’ Walliams last year made more than £7million from book sales. The 43-year-old Britain’s Got Talent judge had four books in last year’s top 50 bestsellers list. His latest book, Awful Auntie, sold more than 500,000 copies last year. The success of his books, which also include Ratburger and Billionaire Boy, has also been boosted by television adaptations, such as The Boy in the Dress, which starred Walliams, Meera Syal and Jennifer Saunders, and was shown on the BBC at Christmas.",

    "input": "By her own admission, Michelle O’Clee’s story of heartbreak and deception reads like the plot of a best-selling novel. A devoted wife, she was cruelly duped by her bigamist husband – who explained away his long absences with a web of lies involving secret safe houses, witness protection, police escorts and serious fraud. It was not until pictures of him doing the ice bucket challenge with his new bride were spotted on Facebook that the awful truth emerged. Now, Michelle, 39, has spoken of her shock and anguish at discovering that her husband of six years had been leading a double life. Michelle O'Clee, 39 (pictured), said her bigamist husband's  'extraordinary lies' were like something from a John Grisham thriller.  Andrew O’Clee, 36, secretly moved in  Philippa Campbell, who lived 40 miles away . ‘In my head it was like dominoes – flashbacks of everything and it all made sense,’ she said. 'I went into survival mode. I didn’t know how he was going to act and I thought, “I don’t even know this man”.’ Far from being the loyal husband she believed him to be, Andrew O’Clee, 36, had secretly moved in with finance manager Philippa Campbell, who lived 40 miles away. He went on to marry her in a lavish wedding while Michelle was pregnant with their first child. The bigamist told his first wife he had to leave their home because he was on a witness protection scheme – and even left mid-way through the birth after claiming that police were waiting for him outside. Last week the ex-soldier was jailed for eight months after admitting bigamy. It later emerged he may even have been searching for wife number three after a profile with his name, age, height and location was spotted on a dating website. Michelle told the Sun on Sunday: ‘They were extraordinary lies. It’s like something from a John Grisham book. ‘This was a man I loved and trusted for 14 years. I’d thought he was the perfect husband.’ Andrew O'Clee, 36, (left) was caught out when he was tagged in a video on Facebook with his new spouse Philippa (right).  The video of the ice bucket challenge was captioned ‘uncle Andrew’ and ‘auntie Philippa’ Michelle met O’Clee in 2000 when they were both working at a branch of River Island. They got engaged a year later. Years after, he would present Miss Campbell with an engagement ring identical to the one he gave Michelle. ‘I thought he was a nice, polite, well-mannered guy,’ Michelle said. ‘We were attracted from the start and he was quite flirtatious. Our first date was on Christmas Eve and he proposed a year later. The ring was exactly the same as Philippa’s, platinum with a princess cut diamond and diamonds on each side. He asked me at the same spot where we’d first kissed.’ After years of saving, the couple spent £30,000 on their dream wedding in 2008, including a lavish reception at the Great Conservatory at Syon Park in West London. But starting a family proved a struggle. Michelle finally discovered she was pregnant in June 2013. ‘It was that year he told me about the witness protection programme and he had to move out,’ she said. O’Clee, who worked for business services provider ISS, claimed he was involved in a fraud trial, which meant he had to leave their rented flat in West London to be placed in a ‘safe house’. In reality, he had moved in with Miss Campbell, 40 miles away. O’Clee married second wife Philippa in August 2013 at St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex (pictured). His first wife Michelle was  pregnant at the time, having discovered she was expecting in June 2013 . Michelle opened up about her heartache after finding out that the ex-soldier had presented his new bride with an identical platinum engagement ring. Pictured: The couple's rings posted on Philippa's Facebook page . The pair married in August the same year at St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex. Miss Campbell, 30, who did not know he was already married, is standing by him. O’Clee forged a decree nisi and told friends and family he had divorced Michelle because she had cheated on him. He even abandoned her while she was giving birth to their daughter, Amelia. ‘At the peak of my labour I was holding on to the bed, and he said “I have to go because the police are waiting for me”,’ Michelle added. ‘I said, “Can you not tell them you’re having a baby? You can’t leave me”. But he did. He joked and said, “Hold it in until I get back”.’ Soon afterwards Michelle began to grow suspicious. Her sister Jasmine eventually learned the truth while browsing Facebook last year. She stumbled across the video of the ice bucket challenge – in which people are filmed being drenched in freezing water for charity. It was captioned ‘uncle Andrew’ and ‘auntie Philippa’. Michelle said: ‘My sister saw it on Andrew’s brother’s Facebook page and thought, “Oooh, who is auntie Philippa?”, then it clicked on to her Facebook page and she saw the profile wedding picture. She told my best friend, who told me Andrew was living a double life. I went into a state of shock. Michelle turned to close friend Myleene Klass (right) for support after discovering the truth behind O'Clee's (left) tangled web of deceit. TV presenter Myleene's own marriage to security boss Graham Quinn also failed . ‘He had isolated and cut me off from everybody. I found out he had told his family we had divorced. I didn’t see his family for a year because he told me he had fallen out with his mother and brother.’ Michelle said she felt ‘stupid’ but had no reason to doubt her husband. ‘He is a liar and I had no idea,’ she added. ‘He was always vague. When I look back, I never asked questions, I just carried on.’ After discovering her husband’s lies, Michelle said she immediately turned for help to her friend, the musician and TV presenter Myleene Klass, whose own marriage to security boss Graham Quinn failed. The pair have been friends for 15 years after they performed together in Miss Saigon in the West End. ‘I knew Myleene would be able to help me,’ Michelle added. ‘Not only is she a strong woman but she has had to deal with difficult issues herself. She’s my rock.’",

    "input": "When Ali Maffucci got a deal to write a cooking and healthy lifestyle book, she quit her corporate job and began working from home. But while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers, secretly she wasn’t practising what she preached. As the months ticked by, she piled on the pounds. But desperate to loser weight for the book's photo shoot, she decided to try adopt a novel way to lose weight. Miss  Maffucci made one simple change to her diet that helped her drop over 11 kg (24 lbs) in just three months. For every meal, she substituted spiralized vegetables for bread, pasta, rice and potatoes.Here, she tells the Healthista website how she went from a size 14/16 to a size 8/10 so rapidly... Scroll down for video . Ali Maffucci, 28, lost 11 kg (almost two stone) in three months through replacing pasta, bread and rice with spirazlied vegetables. She is pictured before (left) and after (right) her weight loss . Now, Ms Maffucci weighs 10 stone, is a size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight . After eating courgette noodles recommended by her mother, Ali Maffucci fell in love with the spiralizing tool. Not long after, she took to the internet with her blog, Inspiralized, where she began creating and sharing recipes using spiralized vegetables. Then in June of 2013, Ms Maffucci quit her corporate job to become a full time blogger. However while she was running the website and sharing healthy recipes with her readers, she was far from a reflection of that herself. Without the structure of her old job, she gained what she called her ‘blogging weight’ of 10 kg (22lbs). The spiralizer is a razor-sharp cutting device that creates thin ribbons of fruits and vegetables. Originally a Japanese invention, it allows people to create nutritious, very low-calorie, low-carb ‘pasta’, ‘noodles’ and ‘rice’ from everyday fruit and vegetables, in less time than it takes to peel a potato. For example, it can spin a simple courgette into a generous bowl of ‘spaghetti’ in a flash. Spiralize a sweet potato and in minutes you’ll apparently get a filling portion of ‘rice’ with just half the calories and carbs of regular basmati. Nutritionists warn it is not a good idea to completely eliminate carbohydrates from the diet entirely, as they provide a range of important nutrients. However, many of us are guilty of eating too many carbs, and a spiralizer could help us cut down, said dietitian Vanessa Hattersley. She said: ‘Many of us do tend to overload our plates with pasta, rice, bread and potatoes when they are on offer. A well-balanced meal should be a quarter protein, a quarter carbohydrate and half fruit and vegetables, so the spiralizer could play a really useful role in redressing the nutritional balance in a carb-heavy diet.’ Being in her apartment all day with her kitchen nearby meant her constant snacking quickly led to weight gain. ‘It wasn’t necessarily that I was eating unhealthy food, it was more that I was eating a lot of healthy food. 'I was eating a half a tub of almond butter instead of a little bit with an apple slice or the whole tub of hummus,’ Ms Maffucci said. ‘I was snacking on many healthy things, but eating too many of them.’ She describes feeling constantly tired. ‘I felt like I was very lazy, even at night time. 'My fiancé would come home and I would make dinner for him, and by the time we were done I would be exhausted, and I would just lay on the couch and probably snack on more food,’ Ms Maffucci said. Later that month, she scored a deal to write a cookbook, which meant she would have to be photographed and featured in it. That’s when she knew she had to turn things around. The ‘blogging weight’ gain had left her at 12 stone and a size 14/16, and she needed to look fit and healthy for the book. ‘I told myself, how could I promote this healthy lifestyle if I wasn’t living it myself?’ She had until late August — about three months — to transform her lifestyle so she could look and feel fit and comfortable during the photo shoot. She made a plan to get to 140-145 pounds (66 kg) - by consistently exercising and eating her own spiralized meals minus the snacks. ‘I said myself \"I’m gonna eat healthy spiralized meals for lunch and dinner, and that kept me satisfied and kept me fueled\". 'It’s such a fun way to eat, you never get bored of what you’re eating. 'It’s healthy and it makes you feel good,’ Ms Maffucci said. ‘I felt satisfied all the time.’ She said didn’t find it difficult to stick to spiralized food. 'It is delicious, after all. If you were to boil some pasta, drain it and then try to eat it, it wouldn’t really taste good; it’s sort of the same thing with spiralized food,' she said. ‘What makes the dish delicious is the sauces and the cooking and the other things you put into it.’ She said by eating food she normally would, and replacing pasta, rice, potatoes and processed food with spiralized vegetables, she didn’t have to sacrifice her taste buds in the name of health. Ms Maffucci said she didn’t find it difficult to stick to spiralized food (her recipe for spiralized courgette with a fried egg is pictured). She said: 'It’s such a fun way to eat, you never get bored of what you’re eating' Ms Maffucci wrote a book, Inspiralized: Inspiring Recipes to Make With Your Spiralizer, following her weight loss . ‘I always tell people, you won’t notice a big change in your flavor profile but you’ll notice it in the way you feel afterwards and how full you feel, and you feel a lot lighter,’ she said. She even mastered how to incorporate weekend indulgences into her diet. ‘I think of all of the foods that I love to eat that aren’t good for me and I literally sit and brainstorm and say how can I make this inspiralized?’ she said. Her recipe for Blueberry Sweet Potato Waffles was one she came up with when she had a craving one hungover Sunday morning. After sticking with the spiralized food and staying true to her exercise schedule, Ms Maffucci reached 150 pounds (68 kg) by early August, extremely close to her goal. Now she rests at ten stone, size 8/10 and is working on toning instead of losing weight. Compared to her old lifestyle, she said she  is much happier, focused and energised. ‘After I lost the weight, I would do something as little as writing a thank you note that before I would push off because I was so exhausted. 'I would clean out my drawers at night instead of sitting on the couch and watching TV. ‘My focus during the days was so much stronger too. Without that old laziness anymore I get so much more done now.’ Visit Ms Maffucci's blog, Inspiralized, for recipes and tips. Her book is available on Amazon.

The Villarreal defender was carried off on a stretcher with 13 minutes to go after his ankle appeared to buckle when he was  running for the ball. The Argentine underwent a successful operation after being taken to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a broken left ankle. Villarreal's Mateo Musacchio runs for the ball near the touchline with 13 minutes left to play . As he closes in on the ball and the sliding opponent, his right foot is bent back, breaking his ankle . Musacchio crumples to the ground in agony after the horrendous ankle break . 'Musacchio has been successfully operated on tonight at the Cemtro Clinic in Madrid after having a dislocation and break of his left ankle,' read a statement on Villarreal's website. 'The recovery time for the footballer will depend on the progress he makes.' An Ikechukwu Uche penalty, after he himself was fouled by Medhi Lacen with 52 minutes played, was Villarreal's first goal in five league games but it was not enough to give them their first La Liga away win of the year. In a scrappy game Getafe deservedly drew level with a fine header from Castro after 64 minutes and Pedro Leon had the chance to win the game but his shot following a breakaway was parried by Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo. Villarreal have failed to win in seven games in all competitions and are sixth on 51 points. Getafe are 13th on 36 points. Barcelona lead the way at the top of the table on 75 points but their advantage was cut to two points following a 2-2 draw with Sevilla on Saturday. Getafe's Freddy takes on Villarreal's Bailly during Sunday's La Liga clash at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez . Getafe's Rodriguez and Denis Cheryshev contest the ball during Sunday's game . Villarreal are sixth in the La Liga table following their 1-1 draw with Getafe on Sunday . An 18-match unbeaten run up until February saw Villarreal alive on three fronts but in the last couple of months the wheels have come off. They were knocked out of the King's Cup and the Europa League while their dreams of a Champions League spot have faded. Injuries have taken their toll with Bruno Soriano and Denis Cheryshev among the key players that have missed games and now the likely loss of Musacchio, who also spent a lengthy spell in the treatment room earlier in the season, would be a big blow.",

    "input": "Two black candidates were among three people elected to the Ferguson City Council Tuesday, tripling African-American representation in the St. Louis suburb where poor race relations have been a focal point since the August shooting death of an 18-year-old black by a white police officer. The election means that half of the six-member city council in Ferguson, a town where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black, will now be African-American. This just over one month after the Department of Justice released a report on the shocking culture of racism and abuse in the city. The lone black incumbent councilman, Dwayne James, was not up for re-election. Scroll down for video . Wesley Bell Jr., 18, left, casts his vote alongside his father Wesley Bell who claimed victory in the race for Ferguson City Council Ward 3 seat . The election came just over a month after a Justice Department report detailed a culture of racism and abuse among city officials, employees and police . Voter turnout increased substantially from the previous election following a strong get-out-the-vote effort from labor unions and other national organizations. The town that drew only 12.3 percent of registered voters last April had 29.4 percent turnout Tuesday, according to the St. Louis County Board of Elections. That was about double the overall turnout in St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located. Unofficial results showed that Wesley Bell defeated another black candidate to win in the 3rd Ward; Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in the 1st Ward; and Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who is white, won a 2nd Ward race against another white candidate. 'This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard,' said councilman-elect Bell. 'When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit.' He described it as part of a healing and rebuilding process. It was the first municipal election in Ferguson since officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. The shooting sparked sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis area, and spawned a national Black Lives Matter movement to press for change in how police deal with local minorities. It also prompted a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which decided not to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November. But the federal department released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit-driven municipal court system. Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge. The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails. The new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements. The scrutiny in the wake of the shooting also found that the city had a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor also is white. Ferguson City Council ward three candidates Lee Smith (R) and Wesley Bell (L) hand out election information . In the race for the 3rd Ward, which includes the apartment complex where Brown was killed, Bell, 40, easily defeated 76-year-old retiree Lee Smith. Bell is a lawyer and a criminology professor who had to defend himself because of a third job - municipal judge in a neighboring town of Velda City that, like Ferguson, derives a large percentage of its budget from municipal court fines. Smith had support of several national organizations whose volunteers went door-to-door on his behalf. Jones had support of a labor union and won easily in her four-person race. Fletcher, the former mayor who started the I Love Ferguson campaign after the unrest that ravaged the community, also won easily in the 2nd Ward. A strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters last year, but just 562 new voters were added to the rolls. In recent weeks, the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote. The high turnout came despite brutal weather. Strong storms, including lightning and heavy rain, tore through the region for several hours before noon. But the weather didn't deter Marty Einig, who has participated in Ferguson protests since August. She was voting in the 3rd Ward, which includes the Canfield Green apartment complex where Brown was fatally shot. 'I see there is raw material within this community to demonstrate hope,' Einig said. 'I see a glass that's half full, and I feel that the people have the will to force change.' Charrolynn Washington agreed, saying the election is where real change will occur. 'As much change is needed here in Ferguson, this is where we begin - not out there in the streets, doing what they were doing - but, right here,' Washington said. 'They need to be voting and putting people in position to make the change and make the decisions that need to be made.'",

    "input": "(CNN)It was all set for a fairytale ending for record breaking jockey AP McCoy. In the end it was a different but familiar name who won the Grand National on Saturday. 25-1 outsider Many Clouds, who had shown little form going into the race, won by a length and a half, ridden by jockey Leighton Aspell. Aspell won last year's Grand National too, making him the first jockey since the 1950s to ride back-to-back winners on different horses. \"It feels wonderful, I asked big questions,\" Aspell said of Many Clouds, moments after his victory. \"Over the fences he was awesome. I was just hoping his batteries would last and they did,\" he added. No fairytale . Yet for much of the Grand National -- arguably the world's most famous and certainly the sport's most prestigious jump race -- it looked as if AP McCoy was about to write an ending befitting the career of a man who has dominated jump racing for two decades. His horse Shutthefrontdoor was in the leading group as it negotiated the likes for Becher's Brooke and The Chair, some of the toughest jumps in racing. Last week the 40-year-old Ulsterman, who has won an astonishing 4,356 races, announced he would retire if he won the Grand National for the second time in his career. Shutthefrontdoor was heavily backed by the betting public sensing a storybook conclusion to McCoy's career. UK and Irish betting firms even predicted they would lose as much as $73 million if McCoy won. He was well placed going into the final straight but just couldn't keep up after Many Clouds cut lose, and finished back in fifth. Third time winner . But for Trevor Hemmings, the owner of Many Clouds, it was his third victory in the Grand National. \"I always dreamed of winning my first National,\" a shocked Hemmings told Channel 4. \"Then along comes a second. That's special. And when a third comes along, it's such a wonderful, wonderful feeling.\" Hemming went on to praise Aspell's performance. \"This morning talking we talked about the achievers,\" said Hemmings. \"They are quiet, confident and experienced. He has all of them.\" McCoy's fifth placed finish means he will race again at least once more, in two weeks time at Sandown.",

    "input": "Even by his stratospheric standards, this was something very special. Cristiano Ronaldo was back to his brilliant, unplayable best as he scored five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada on Sunday, among them an eight-minute hat-trick. That treble was Ronaldo's 31st career hat-trick and his 24th in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi's record in the competition. It also took his formidable goal tally for the Bernabeu club to 299 in 287 matches. Against Granada, Ronaldo has now scored 11 times in just eight matches. But, compared with some, they have got off quite lightly. We take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the Portuguese wonder. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals as Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 on Sunday afternoon . The Portuguese superstar was simply irresistible as Real ran riot at the Bernabeu . SEVILLA - 18 Goals in 12 matches . There's no denying it - Ronaldo just loves playing against Sevilla, whose defence must be terrified every time they see him. Three of those La Liga hat-tricks have come against the team from Andalusia - he scored triples in a 6-2 win at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in May 2011, a 4-1 success at the Bernabeu in February 2013 and a 7-3 thrashing in October of the same year. But they aren't even Ronaldo's best return. He scored four goals, including a 12-minute hat-trick, in another 6-2 win in Seville back in May 2011. Most recently, Ronaldo scored twice in Real's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla in August. Ronaldo celebrates with James Rodriguez after scoring in Real's 2014 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla . ATLETICO MADRID - 15 Goals in 20 matches . Madrid derbies have been pretty common in recent years - not only in La Liga but also in the Copa del Rey (they're met in four of the last five seasons) and, of course, last season's Champions League final. In the 2011-12 league fixtures, Ronaldo scored twice against Atleti at the Bernabeu and three times against them at Vicente Calderon. Both matches ended in 4-1 wins for Real. But the most famous was in Lisbon last May, when Ronaldo scored Real's fourth in the Champions League final and ran off for that shirtless celebration. Ronaldo whips off his shirt to celebrate scoring the fourth goal in Real's 2014 Champions League final win . BARCELONA - 15 Goals in 26 matches . As a Manchester United player, Ronaldo failed to score in five meetings with Barcelona but that soon changed when he switched to Real Madrid in 2009. Scored: 417 goals . Against: 82 clubs . He scored an extra-time header to win the Copa del Rey final of 2011 and claim his first piece of silverware at the Bernabeu. And the Clasico goals have flowed regularly since - Ronaldo has scored seven against Barca in the league, five in the Copa del Rey and three in the Supercopa. With Ronaldo and Messi in a never-ending 'anything you can do' contest, there should be many more to come. Lionel Messi was left scratching his head after Ronaldo scored in the Clasico last October . GETAFE - 15 Goals in nine matches . Ronaldo really has it in for Getafe with an excellent scoring ratio against Madrid's city rivals. He notched hat-tricks against them in both the 2010-11 season and the 2012-13 campaign and added two more in a 3-0 Real win when the sides met at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez back in January. I doubt Getafe are looking forward to their last-day visit to the Bernabeu very much... Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Getafe at the Bernabeu in May 2011 . ATHLETIC BILBAO - 14 Goals in 12 matches . Another team Ronaldo averages better than a goal a game against is Bilbao. He topped up his impressive record against the Basques with a hat-trick in a 5-0 home win earlier this season. That was the second time he has scored three against them - the other came in a 5-1 Bernabeu victory in November 2010. Ronaldo also registered doubles in a 4-1 win in January 2012 and a 3-0 win at San Mames in April 2013. Ronaldo heads home Real's second goal against Athletic Bilbao in a La Liga meeting in September 2013 . MALAGA - 13 Goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo has Malaga in the crosshairs too, averaging a goal a game in his 13 encounters with them. He has scored two hat-tricks against them, in a 7-0 demolition at the Bernabeu in March 2011 and a 4-0 success at La Rosaleda in October the same year. It almost came as a surprise when Ronaldo failed to find the net against them back in November - but he did contribute two assists instead. Ronaldo wheels away in celebration after scoring against Malaga back in January 2010 . CELTA VIGO - 12 goals in six matches . Ronaldo's best scoring ratio is against Celta Vigo where he has an incredible average of two goals a game. Admittedly, there have only been six games since Celta returned to the top flight but nearly all of them have been messy. Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 home win earlier this season and he also scored three in a Copa del Rey tie in January 2013. Indeed, Ronaldo has scored every time he's faced them. Ronaldo averages two goals a game against Celta Vigo - including this one in December 2014 . LEVANTE - 12 Goals in 11 matches . Levante have also served as target practice for Ronaldo too over the years, with the goals coming at regular intervals. Earlier this season, Ronaldo helped himself to two as Real routed them 5-0 at the Ciutat de Valencia. A Copa del Rey tie in December 2010 saw Ronaldo score three of Real's eight strikes. On target for Real in an away La Liga match with Levante back in November 2012 . VILLARREAL - 11 Goals in 13 matches . After drawing a blank four times against Villarreal with Manchester United, Ronaldo has well and truly made up for lost time. He has scored 11 times in nine La Liga encounters, including a hat-trick in a 4-2 home win in January 2011 (plus an assist for good measure). Ronaldo extended his scoring streak against the Yellow Submarine this season, netting both home and away. A high-five for Gareth Bale after scoring against Villarreal earlier this season. The game ended 2-2 . GRANADA - 11 Goals in eight matches . Ronaldo sliced through the Granada defence on Sunday like a knife through butter, registering the first five-goal haul of his career. He also took his impressive tally against this particular opponent to 11 goals in eight outings. Ronaldo points to the heavens after scoring for Real Madrid against Granada last season . RONALDO AGAINST THE ENGLISH TEAMS . Ronaldo's prolific scoring record against the Spanish clubs means you have to go down to No 16 on the overall list to find the Premier League opponent he has scored most against. It's Aston Villa - Ronaldo scored nine times in 14 matches against them during his time with Manchester United. He also has eight in 16 meetings with Tottenham Hotspur. But how about the leading teams in England? ARSENAL - Six goals in 15 matches . Ronaldo mustered half a dozen goals for Manchester United against the Gunners during his six seasons at Old Trafford. The most significant were the two at the Emirates to deliver United into the 2009 Champions League final, while he also scored twice in a 4-2 success at Highbury in February 2005. Ronaldo celebrates his stunning free-kick for Manchester United in the Champions League semi with Arsenal . MANCHESTER CITY - Five goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo scored four times in Manchester derbies during his time at Old Trafford - and also found the target against City for Real Madrid in a 2012 Champions League tie. His most telling contribution was a penalty at the Etihad in May 2007 as United beat their rivals 1-0 en route to the Premier League title. A youthful Ronaldo scored twice as United beat City 4-2 in an FA Cup tie in February 2004 . LIVERPOOL - Three goals in 11 matches . Ronaldo has struggled for goals against Liverpool - scoring twice against them for United and then adding another in Real's 3-0 win at Anfield earlier this season. That was his first time scoring at Anfield as the other two came at Old Trafford in contrasting circumstances - a 3-0 win in March 2008 and a 4-1 loss in March 2009. Ronaldo draws the ire of the Anfield crowd after scoring there for Real Madrid earlier this season . MANCHESTER UNITED - Two goals in two matches . Ronaldo came back to haunt Sir Alex Ferguson and United by scoring in both legs of their 2013 Champions League last-16 tie. His header cancelled out Danny Welbeck's opener in the Bernabeu and he then scored the decisive goal at Old Trafford - refusing to celebrate - after Nani had been sent off for United. Ronaldo refused to celebrate after scoring the goal that knocked Man United out of Europe in 2013 . CHELSEA - One goal in 15 matches . Ronaldo's record against Chelsea is poor - having found the net just once against the London side in 15 appearances. Mind you, it was an incredibly important one, a header in the 2008 Champions League final as United claimed their third European Cup triumph. Ronaldo towers above the Chelsea defence to head home during the 2008 Champions League final . 18 - Sevilla . 15 - Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Getafe . 14 - Atletico Bilbao . 13 - Malaga . 12 - Celta Vigo, Levante . 11 - Villarreal, Granada . 10 - Osasuna . 9 - Aston Villa, Valencia, Rayo Vallecano, Real Sociedad, Deportivo . 8 - Tottenham . 7 - Schalke, Ajax, Zaragoza, Mallorca, Elche, Almeria, Fulham, Wigan . 6 - Racing Santander, Galatasaray, Arsenal, Bolton, Newcastle, Portsmouth . 5 - Everton, Manchester City, West Ham, Middlesbrough . 4 - Bayern Munich, Marseille, Lyon, Xerez, Espanyol, Derby, West Brom, Reading . 3 - FC Copenhagen, Borussia Dortmund, Roma, Juventus, CSKA Moscow, Real Betis, Valldolid, Dinamo Moscow, Liverpool, Blackburn . 2 - Ludogorets, AC Milan, Sporting Lisbon, Basle, Zurich, Eibar, Gijon, Hercules, APOEL, Southampton, Birmingham, Stoke, Hull, Manchester United, Watford . 1 - Auxerre, Inter, Gamba Osaka, Porto, Murcia, Tenerife, Cordoba, Ponferradina, Debreceni, Sunderland, Charlton, Chelsea, Millwall, Exeter .",
    "output": "Ronaldo scored five times in Real Madrid's 9-1 win over Granada .\nIt takes his total to 11 goals in eight matches against them .\nBut Granada have got off lightly compared to some teams he has faced .\nRonaldo has 18 goals in 12 against Sevilla; 15 in 20 versus Atletico .\nPortuguese has 15 goals in nine against Getafe and 12 in six vs Celta Vigo ."

The Wales and Lions wing will be reassessed at the end of April and could face an even longer spell on the sidelines if specialist consultants are not convinced that he is ready to return to action. Saints medics will monitor his progress throughout the stand-down period and - with the weight of impact required to induce concussion reducing the more times a player suffers head injuries – there have been growing concerns about the 22-year-old's welfare. George North suffered a third confirmed concussion in just four months against Wasps last Friday . Nathan Hughes' knee collided with North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . 'We have listened to the advice we sought and George will be taking some time away from the field,' said Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder. 'Throughout this process it is important that George's welfare comes first and that he is treated patiently and calmly, only returning to action when all of the medical team are happy for him to do so.' North was knocked out following a collision with the knee of Wasps back-row Nathan Hughes. The No 8 was been subsequently suspended for three weeks, however his club yesterday launched an appeal against ban on the grounds that it was an accident. North receives treatment for his head injury on the pitch and has now been ruled out for at least a month . Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks after knocking out North with his right leg . During Wales' RBS 6 Nations opener against England, North was accidentally allowed to stay on the pitch with concussion, prompting one of the most high-profile debates about the risk of head injuries. In Tuesday's Sportsmail, former Scotland full back Rory Lamont — who has suffered the after-effects of brain injuries — called for the Welshman to be rested until the World Cup, saying: 'It's a complete disgrace that it has got to this stage.

    "input": "A husband has penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay-at-home mother. Steven Nelms writes in the essay's introduction that he can't afford his wife to be a stay-at home. 'I don't at all mean to offend anyone with this post,' he writes. 'I'd like to explain exactly what that means so that no one thinks I'm in any way devaluing Stay-At-Home Moms.' Steven Nelms penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay-at-home mother to their two-year-old son Ezra . 'On the contrary, I mean that I quite literally cannot afford my wife to be staying at home.' Nelms told the Independent Journal Review that his wife, Glorianna, stays at home with the couple's two-year-old son Ezra because of high child care costs. But Nelms said working has always been a part of Gloriana's life, who had been employed since she was 14 and was contributing to her family's income when she was 17. 'Getting a paycheck was significant part of feeling valued and appreciated for all the hard work she did to provide for herself and help her family,' he sad. So Nelms, from Plano, Texas, decided to write an essay, which was posted on We Are Glory, in which he would break-down the monetary value of everything his wife does to care for the family. 'Yes, my wife is my son’s mother and it is a natural result of being a parent to love and care for your own child,' he writes. 'There is also a very quantifiable dollar amount that can be attributed to the services rendered.' 'I am in no way trying to simplify, objectify, or devalue the priceless love of a mother for her child,' he wrote. 'But let’s be real. Pay day feels good for a reason. Because you’re seeing your hard work appreciated in a tangible way that lets you “treat yo self”'. In the essay Nelms says he 'can't afford' his wife to be a stay-at-home mother, and then breaks down the monetary value of all that she provides. 'I would have to make over $100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a Stay-At-Home Mom!' he writes . Nelms said that he felt 'ashamed' for every time his wife felt she didn't have 'as much right to our income as I do' and that his income 'doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family' Nelms estimates that the childcare his wife provides is worth $36,660 a year, the annual-salary for a full-time nanny. He also estimates this his wife does $5,200 worth of cleaning a year, $12,480 of cooking, and $13,520 for buying groceries and running errands. After adding that his wife helps deal with the family's finances and does the laundry, he concludes that his wife's annual salary should be $73,960. 'I would have to make over $100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a Stay-At-Home Mom!' he writes. 'In short, I can’t afford for my wife to stay at home. And I’ve tragically failed to show my wife the appreciation that she deserves.' Nelms admits in the essay that he has felt 'ashamed' every time he has ever made his wife feel guilty of humored when she has bought something for herself. 'I am ashamed that she has ever felt like she doesn't have just as much right to our income as I do. The fact of the matter is that our income doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family.' 'She loves me, loves our son, and loves our family, so obviously she isn’t doing any of those things for a paycheck or even for recognition.' 'But it certainly doesn’t hurt to know that as a Stay-At-Home Mom her appraised salary is nearly double my actual income.' Nelms concludes the essay by telling his wife 'you are more precious than rubies.' Nelms concludes the essay by telling his wife 'you are more precious than rubies'",

    "input": "Raheem Sterling is earning less than Mario Balotelli. In fact he's earning less than half of what Balotelli is on at Liverpool. Puts a few things into perspective doesn't it? Liverpool Football Club have made some poor decisions in terms of signings and contracts since Luis Suarez departed, and those mistakes look set to cost them their place in the top four. For Brendan Rodgers' sake whoever is in charge of sorting out Sterling's new contract this summer needs to get it right. If they think they can afford to lose Suarez, Gerrard and Sterling in the space of 12 months they are very much mistaken. Raheem Sterling's contract negotiations have dominated the headlines in the past fortnight . Sterling shares a laugh in training ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup replay with Blackburn on Wednesday . Mario Balotelli earns more than double Sterling at present despite failing to perform in a Liverpool shirt . Sterling's agent has been accused of giving him bad advice. Apparently what people want his agent to tell him is that he's not particularly good, he's too young to earn big money, and he should sign whatever contract Liverpool offer him because he should be grateful just to even be there. The advice the agent gave was to turn down the contract offer and focus on football until the summer. Sounds reasonable to me. The big problem here is not the tired old narrative of a young greedy footballer. It's that Liverpool, through Rodgers, have repeatedly told the press and the fans that there would be no problem and Sterling would sign the new deal. In the middle of December, Rodgers described Sterling as 'a talisman' and told us he was confident he would stay. At the end of January, Rodgers told us the contract would be 'concluded imminently'. Last month he described the new offer to Sterling as 'incredible'. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has always insisted that the Sterling talks would be concluded soon . Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal, admitting he was 'flattered' by their interest . Rodgers has repeatedly insisted that Sterling will not be moving anywhere this summer . Liverpool find themselves seven points adrift in the race for the Champions League places . Rodgers has said things there he had no right to say, but those assurances he gave have now served to make Sterling and his agent out to be the bad guys. The astonished response of hypocritical ex-pros and pundits stuck in an era where the maximum wage still exists was blown up beyond proportion. 'How dare this greedy young man who's won nothing, scored less goals than Jon Walters (who thought that one up?) turn down this incredible offer from this great club. He should be grateful to be at such a club.' This was the standard response from people out of touch with the modern game. The 'incredible' deal was actually an offer which put Sterling on a par with Balotelli. Liverpool Football Club should be embarrassed by that offer to Raheem Sterling, a player who kept quiet last summer when he watched Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Balotelli all walk through the door and sign deals worth more than double what he was on. He then stayed quiet while his performances were being scrutinised more than most in the absence of Suarez and Sturridge, with Lallana injured at the start of the campaign and with Gerrard fading fast. Adam Lallana has been hindered by injuries since he arrived at Anfield from Southampton last summer . Dejan Lovren also arrived at Liverpool from Southampton in the summer and earns more than Sterling . The departure of Steven Gerrard to the MLS this summer will free up space on Liverpool's wage bill . Meantime Rodgers said there would be no issue with Sterling signing again, so when it turned out there was a problem, Sterling was instantly the bad guy, along with his agent. Now the message from those who want to bring Sterling down is that he's not very good. 'He's not good enough to move to a bigger club' (since when were Liverpool a small club by the way?) 'He would be stuck on the bench if he moved.' 'Coutinho is better.' 'Let him go, Jordan Ibe is coming through.' If people want to believe all that it's up to them, but it won't alter these facts: . Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson are set to leave this summer which will free up a huge amount of the wages budget at Anfield. Philippe Coutinho would provide an alternative should Sterling depart Anfield in the summer . The emergence of teenage winger Jordon Ibe also suggests there could be life beyond Sterling at Liverpool . Sterling should be playing Champions League football - something Liverpool may not offer next season . Gerrard knows all about contract situations not being addressed, and that's why he said two months ago that the club need to sort out the futures of Sterling and Henderson 'before it's too late'. It was an important message from the captain that got lost in all the negative spin aimed at bringing Sterling and his agent's credibility down. The last two defeats have brought the debate back to where it should be: the mistakes made by Rodgers and Liverpool. Ramping up the hate towards a young English player who wants to play in the Champions League and wants to earn significantly more than a total waste of space like Mario Balotelli will hopefully now be seen for what it is – a way of deflecting from the real issues at Anfield. What's really disappointing is that a young talented player has had to put up with all this criticism. It's classically English I'm afraid. Those critics should be ashamed of themselves. Seriously - imagine if Real Madrid do want Sterling this summer, as Liverpool prepare for a Europa League campaign. Would it be good advice to turn down that move?",
    "output": "Raheem Sterling is currently earning less than half Mario Balotelli's salary .\nEven signing new £100,000-a-week deal would only take him to parity .\nLiverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted Sterling will put pen to paper .\nBut he has assumed he'll stay at Liverpool when he has other ambitions .\nSterling should be playing in the Champions League .\nAnd Liverpool, seven points off fourth place, may not be able to offer that .\nAdrian Durham: Arsenal only turn it on when the pressure is off .\nDurham: Rooney and Carrick are Man Utd's only players with the 'football intelligence' demanded by Louis van Gaal .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news .\nRaheem Sterling is a very good player .\nHe's been performing at a high level consistently for two seasons .\nIf a club is prepared to pay £50m he would play regularly for them .\nThere would be no shortage of clubs wanting to sign him – Real Madrid have already said they are monitoring his situation .\nRodgers says they won't sell this summer, but it's more bluster I'm afraid. Common sense dictates they can't afford to let his contract run down to its final year. The situation needs to be addressed .\nSterling wants to play Champions League football. What's so wrong with that?"

That’s the surprising conclusion of a study that found that large amounts of ice were not just at the Martian poles, but likely towards the equator as well. It means that, if all ice were to be spread across the surface of Mars, the entire planet would be covered in more than 3.3ft (one metre). This image from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows that a thick layer of dust on Mars covers the glaciers, so they appear as the surface of the ground, but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust . The latest research was carried out by scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June 2013, Curiosity found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. Images from several Martian satellites had revealed the shape of glaciers just below the surface, and confirmed most were made of water-ice. And now the researchers have measured how big the glaciers are, and their similarity to glaciers on Earth. In total there is more than 150 billion cubic metres of ice on Mars, which could ‘cover the entire surface of Mars with 1.1 metres of ice,’ explained Dr Nanna Bjørnholt Karlsson at the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute. She added that the ice closer to the Martian equator was ‘an important part of Mars’ water reservoir.’ There are thought to be thousands of glacier-like formations on the planet in both the northern and southern hemispheres. They are located on Mars between latitude 30.0 and 50.0 - equivalent to just south of Denmark’s location on Earth. Mars has belts of glaciers at its central latitudes - between the blue lines, in both the southern and northern hemispheres. A thick layer of dust covers the glaciers, so they appear as the surface of the ground, but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust . Using radar measurements (shown) from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, researchers have been able to identify thousands of glacier-like formations on Mars. They can see how thick the ice is on the radar images . As the ice has not evaporated into space, the dust must be protecting it. If the ice were unprotected, it would evaporate and become water vapour, owing to the low atmospheric pressure on Mars. ‘We have looked at radar measurements spanning ten years back in time to see how thick the ice is and how it behaves,’ Dr Nanna Bjørnholt Karlsson explained. ‘A glacier is after all a big chunk of ice and it flows and gets a form that tells us something about how soft it is. ‘We then compared this with how glaciers on Earth behave and from that we have been able to make models for the ice flow.’ The latest research was carried out by scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. They looked at how big the glaciers were, and also how similar they were to glaciers on Earth (one in Alaska shown) Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, artist's illustration shown, launched on 12 August 2005. It entered Martian orbit on 10 March 2006, and continues to remain operational today. It is tasked with imaging the surface, and also monitors weather and surface conditions on Mars .",
    "output": "Danish scientists studied ice hidden under the surface of Mars .\nDust is thought to be covering huge glaciers on the surface .\nAnd the researchers say there is more water-ice than anticipated .\nIf spread out it would cover the surface in 3.6ft (1.1 metres) of ice ."

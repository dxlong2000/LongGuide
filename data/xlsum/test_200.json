        "text":"By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent\n\nIn some regions, such as southern England, floods are now occurring 15 days earlier than they did half a century ago.\n\nBut the changes aren't uniform, with rivers around the North Sea seeing floods delayed by around eight days.\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Science.\n\nFloods caused by rivers impact more people than any other natural hazard, and the estimated global damages run to over a $100bn a year. \n\nResearchers have long predicted that a warming world would have direct impacts on these events but until now the evidence has been hard to establish. \n\nFloods are affected by many different factors in addition to rainfall, such as the amount of moisture already in the soil and other questions such as changes in land-use that can speed up water run-off from hillsides.  \n\nThis new study looks at this issue in some depth, by creating a Europe-wide database of observations from 4,262 hydrometric stations in 38 countries, dating back to 1960.\n\nThe analysis finds a clear but complex impact of climate change on river flooding. \n\nThe most consistent changes are in north-eastern Europe around Scandinavia where earlier snow melt due to warmer temperatures is leading to earlier spring floods. Around 50% of monitoring stations are seeing floods eight days earlier than they did 50 years ago.\n\nThe biggest changes are seen along the western edge of Europe, from Portugal up to Southern England. Half the stations recorded floods at least 15 days earlier than previously. A quarter of the stations saw flooding more than 36 days earlier than in 1960. \n\nIn these regions, the issue isn't snow melt - it's more about saturated soils.  Maximum rainfall tends to occur in the autumn and gets stored in the soils. Heavier and earlier rain means that the groundwater reaches capacity earlier. \n\n\"It's the interplay between extreme rainfall and the abundance of rainfall,\" lead author Prof G\u00fcnter Bl\u00f6schl, from the Technical University of Vienna, told BBC News. \n\n\"In southern England, it has been raining more, longer and more intensely than in the past. This has created a rising groundwater table and higher soil moisture than usual and combined with intense rainfall this produces earlier river floods.\" \n\nHowever, around the North Sea, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Scotland, the trend is towards later floods. \n\nThe scientists believe this is due to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the weather phenomenon that pushes storms across the ocean into Europe. \n\nThe NAO is driven by differences in atmospheric pressure between the North Pole and the Equator. Recent, rapid changes in temperatures in the Arctic are interfering with these pressure levels and changing the track of the oscillation and storms as well. \n\nAccording to this study, the storms are arriving later and as a result some river flooding happens later too. \n\nProf Bl\u00f6schl says that this study shows clear evidence of the impact of human-induced climate change in many regions - but there are still some areas of uncertainty. \n\n\"Where the human imprint is obvious is in the northeast of Europe. It is quite a direct link, with a warming climate and earlier snow melt,\" he said.  \n\n\"However, the areas impacted by the NAO are more difficult to attribute to anthropogenic global warming. The jury is still out on that aspect.\"\n\nThe study foresees subtle but significant impacts that could arise from the change in flood timing. There could be effects on river ecosystems with salmon spawning later in the year. There could also be implications for hydropower stations, and for agriculture if fields stay wetter for longer. \n\n\"The more serious concern is that if warming impacts the seasonality it may also impact the scale of flooding,\" said Prof Bl\u00f6schl.\n\n\"You could think of timing changes as the harbinger of future changes of flood magnitude. That is the more serious concern. If that happens, flood risk management will have to adapt and that will be different in different parts of Europe.\"\n\nOther experts believe that the changes in flood timing identified by this study have significant implications for how we understand the risk of river floods and how we deal with them. \n\n\"Nearly every major city and town in Europe is built on a river and we protect this urban infrastructure by using past floods as a gauge of the potential risk,\" said Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London.  \n\n\"The study shows that this approach underestimates the risk, as climate change has made European floods occur earlier in the year, increasing their potential impact.  \n\n\"This means all the infrastructure that we have built to protect our cities needs to be reviewed as much of it will be inadequate to protect us from future climate change-induced extreme flooding.\"\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook.\n\n"

        "text":"Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent\n\nAnd if you took another list, of the top 20 places with the highest level of social mobility, 17 of them would also be in London.\n\nIs that a coincidence?\n\nHead teachers in the Worth Less? campaign over school funding shortages say that if the government is serious about promoting social mobility in education, then it needs to look at how low funding seems to mirror low mobility.\n\nWest Somerset has the lowest place on the government's social mobility index - and is also one of the lowest-funded areas.\n\nThe Worth Less? campaign, which has brought together about 5,000 schools over the issue of fair funding, has produced an analysis showing that a secondary school in West Somerset would receive \u00a32m less per year than a similar sized school in Westminster.\n\nWestminster, in the top 10 for funding, is rated as giving its disadvantaged young people the highest chance of social mobility in the country.\n\nAnd a key aspect of the success of London's schools has been that poorer youngsters, such as those eligible for free school meals, do much better in the capital than elsewhere.\n\nFunding gaps\n\nOf course, there are many other crosswinds in such a complex topic.\n\nSchools in London get more funding because they have bigger challenges - extra costs because of their location and extra demands, such as high levels of deprivation and many pupils speaking English as a second language.\n\nIt has often been claimed that London has its own demographic microclimate, with many migrant families arriving with high ambitions for their children.\n\nBut head teachers argue that there's no escaping the overlap between social mobility and financial support. None of the lowest-funded 20 authorities makes it into the top 50 for social mobility.\n\nAnd the top 10s for funding and social mobility are shuffling very similar packs.\n\nTop 10 for funding\n\nTop 10 for social mobility\n\nJules White, a head teacher from West Sussex who has co-ordinated the Worth Less? school funding campaign, is calling for a much closer look at what the variation in funding really means for those outside the capital.\n\nThe funding gap between West Somerset and Westminster, for an individual school, is the equivalent of dozens of extra teaching staff, after-school clubs, university links, careers advice and support for pupils who are struggling.\n\nAnd these are exactly the kinds of added extras that could improve social mobility.\n\nMr White, speaking at a Westminster Education Forum event on school funding, has broken down the figures to per-pupil spending.\n\nBarnsley, near the bottom for social mobility, has \u00a34,729 for each secondary pupil, while Hackney, in the top five for social mobility, receives \u00a37,840.\n\nHow much could schools in Barnsley help their young people with an extra \u00a31,000 per term for each of them? Or what more progress could be supported in other areas on the bottom rungs for funding, such as York, Leicestershire and West Sussex.\n\nBut it's not always such a neat match between funding and social mobility. Nottingham and Manchester are among areas that are relatively well-funded, but don't do particularly well on social mobility.\n\nTightrope act\n\nThe Westminster forum on funding heard warnings that the answer was not taking money from schools in the capital.\n\nA chair of governors from a secondary school in Lambeth said that the changes proposed in the new national funding formula would leave them with a budget deficit heading towards \u00a3500,000, which could only be resolved by significant cuts in the teaching staff.\n\nValentine Mulholland, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the funding squeeze had already meant the loss of jobs for teaching and support staff. \n\nAnd a study from the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) suggested higher spending particularly benefited disadvantaged pupils.\n\nNew Education Secretary Damian Hinds has made a priority of social mobility - but he will also have to make some big decisions about the pressure over school funding.\n\nThe Department for Education has consistently argued that there are record levels of funding - and the NFER's Ben Durbin agreed that by international standards, England's schools are relatively well-funded.\n\nThe political tightrope act for ministers is to push more cash to the less well-funded areas without damaging those schools performing well in better-funded places.\n\nBut the head teachers are arguing that funding and social mobility should no longer be seen as separate conversations.\n\n"

Fare prices increased dramatically between February and March this year and then fell sharply in April. \n\nThe price of clothing and footwear also fell as retailers dropped prices to try to revive sales hit by last month's cold weather.\n\nAn alternative inflation measure, the Retail Prices Index, which is still used to index some rents and pensions, also fell from an annual rate of 1.6% in March to 1.3% in April.\n\nMeanwhile core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell to 1.2%, compared with economists' expectations for 1.4%.\n\nInterest rates\n\nLast week, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, had to write his sixth letter to the Chancellor George Osborne explaining why CPI inflation was still below the Bank's 2% target. \n\nIn it he said: \"The underlying causes of the below-target inflation of the past year and a half have been: sharp falls in commodity prices, the past appreciation of sterling, and to a lesser degree the subdued pace of domestic cost growth.\"\n\nThe Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted last week to keep interest rates unchanged at the record low of 0.5%. The Bank is not expected to raise rates until at least next year.\n\nMartin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: \"We are likely to see inflation remain close to current rates until the latter part of the year, when the base effects associated with last winter's collapse in the oil price will begin to kick in and finally drag the CPI measure above 1%. \n\nSuch a benign outlook is likely to stay the MPC's hand until well into next year.\"\n\nIn a separate report, the ONS said that there had been a surge in house prices as landlords rushed to buy before higher stamp duty was imposed.\n\nUK average house prices increased by 9.0% over the year to March 2016, up from 7.6% in the year to February 2016.\n\nThe pound lost about half a cent against the dollar immediately after the figures were released, but then recovered to stand at $1.4483, a gain on the day of more than 0.5%.\n\n"

Now there are only about 50.\n\nIt's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island.\n\n\"In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,\" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division.\n\nHowever, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use.\n\nIn recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts.\n\nThis reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline.\n\nHealth benefits?\n\nAt the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (\u00a32.1m) per annum.\n\nBut in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level.\n\nProduction and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years. \n\nFollowing a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow.\n\nITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses.\n\nNaturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants.\n\nAlso said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams.\n\nMeanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air.\n\nYet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered with charcoal.\n\nMany people who have never tasted them are queasy about giving them a try, but they actually taste good, not at all like charcoal, and are believed to have health benefits.\n\nSuch diversification has bought new hope to Taiwan's bamboo industry.\n\n\"When I was growing up, the toys we played with were made of bamboo,\" says Chen Ching-fu, general manager of the Bamboo Culture Park in Zhushan - a manufacturer of bamboo product, and the first visitor attraction in Taiwan devoted to the plant.\n\n\"Bamboo was all around us, but never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different types of products.\"\n\nLike other businesses, Mr Chen's now sells not only traditional bamboo furniture, but other products such as air fresheners and clothing.\n\nBesides bamboo charcoal, the Taiwanese have also found ways to use the actual bamboo to make a much wider variety of products than their ancestors did, including floor panels, pens, clothes hangers and even laptop casings.\n\nSales of goods made from all forms of bamboo in Taiwan now reach $100m, with exports increasing alongside domestic sales.\n\nNew spin\n\nOne of the trends helping to drive the revival of the industry is the return of second or third generation young people to help run family businesses.\n\nLin Li-wei, 36, worked at a post office in the capital Taipei after graduating from college. But, making only about $600 a month, he came back to assist his father, who made bamboo ear diggers used by Chinese and Japanese people to remove earwax.\n\nHe's now put a new spin on the family business - making modern looking clocks, lamps and wall lights out of bamboo. He has been receiving orders for his creations.\n\n\"My father supports me trying to innovate,\" says Mr Lin. \"Only through innovations can we add value to our products and continue our business.\"\n\nNow he and his father make $5,000 a month.\n\nMany of the manufacturers in Zhushan are breaking even, but not making big profits. Still, they persevere, seeing it as their mission to continue to promote the use of bamboo.\n\nBamboo grows fast - just five years to reach maturity, making it one of the most environmentally-friendly plants to use. So growers and industry leaders hope they can replace the use of many types of other wood, and plastic.\n\n\"Plastic is very cheap and can be used for a longer time, but what a shame. Bamboo is more environmentally friendly, no chemicals are used to make bamboo products, and the trees grow without the need for fertiliser or pesticides,\" said the Forestry Bureau's Mr Yang.\n\n\"Bamboo can also absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and can reduce greenhouse gases.\"\n\nBack at the Bamboo Culture Park, Mr Chen has created a do-it-yourself workshop where schoolchildren and other tourists can learn how bamboo charcoal is made and make their own bamboo products.\n\n\"Taiwan can't be without bamboo because it's a material we've relied on for generations,\" says Mr Chen. \"I want to help people understand the importance and benefits of using bamboo.\"\n\nTo hear Cindy Sui's radio version of her look at Taiwan's bamboo industry, check out the latest edition of the BBC World Service's Business Matters programme.\n\n"

The protesters must leave.\"\n\nPresident Trump later called on his supporters to \"go home\", while continuing to make false claims of electoral fraud. Twitter and Facebook later froze his accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting.\n\nAsked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: \"The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition.\"\n\nIt is a truism of British diplomacy that every occupant of 10 Downing Street has to get on with every occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, regardless of their politics or character. \n\nPersonal consideration is pushed aside. \n\nWhat matters is the national interest and staying close to one of Britain's closest allies. \n\nThus even now, even after Donald Trump's incitement of the Capitol mob, even though there are less than two weeks until the inauguration, even as close Republican allies jump ship, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab were reluctant to criticise the president by name in their initial response overnight. \n\nYes, they condemned the violence. But of Mr Trump, not a word. \n\nThis caution was matched by the prime ministers of fellow so-called Five Eyes intelligence allies, Australia and New Zealand, both of whom also both failed to mention Mr Trump in their condemnatory tweets. \n\nIn contrast, European leaders were quick to blame the President personally. It was only this morning that a British minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, felt able to follow suit in strong terms. \n\nSo was this natural and sensible diplomatic caution in the midst of a febrile crisis? \n\nOr was this, as some Labour figures are already claiming, a function of the closeness between the current UK government and the Trump administration? \n\nIt was only a few weeks ago that the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, told The Sun that he would miss Donald Trump because he was a good friend to Britain. \n\nWhatever one's views, it is certainly the case that the British government is seen on the international stage by some has having ideological proximity to Mr Trump. \n\nChanging that reputation is seen by many diplomats as a priority in the months ahead, a task made more urgent by events overnight. \n\n"

        "text":"In the Mail on Sunday, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was \"feeble\" and \"pathetic\".\n\nHe has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a \"disgusting moment\" in politics.\n\nAnd Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for \"measured language\" to be used.\n\nWriting in the same paper, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line \"in the face of intense pressure\".\n\nThe UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU.\n\nIn his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of \"bullying\" the UK - but questioned why the response had been \"so utterly feeble\". \n\nHe said that rather than getting a \"generous free trade deal\", Britain is saying, \"yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir\", to Brussels. \n\n\"At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,\" wrote Mr Johnson. \n\n\"It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla.\"\n\nHe said the reason for the UK's response was the \"insanity of the so-called backstop\" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.\n\nHowever, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has been heavily criticised by Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP. \n\nSinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were \"foolish and dangerous\", while the SDLP said he had \"absolutely no regard for people on this island\".\n\nThe BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the \"scathing remarks\" by Mr Johnson showed his \"willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed\" after recent revelations about his private life.\n\nIt is Mr Johnson's second attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal \"means disaster\" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered \"no new ideas\".\n\n'Hurtful analogy'\n\nWhile Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks.\n\nFormer Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan.\n\nHe said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans \"isn't funny\", adding: \"Some need to grow up\".\n\nForeign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan criticised his former boss, saying the article was \"one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics.\"  \n\nIf this latest broadside was not the end of Mr Johnson's political career, \"I will make sure it is later\", he said.\n\nAnother Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: \"I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy.\n\n\"If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough.\"\n\nBut backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was \"vitriol\", saying his critics were \"terrified of his popular appeal\".\n\nAnd Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson \"says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power\" was \"something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public\".\n\nOn the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: \"I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see.\"\n\nHe backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented \"the only deal that we've got on the table\".\n\nIn his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: \"Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation.\"\n\nJohnson 'dossier'\n\nIt is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler, confirmed they were getting divorced earlier this week.\n\nThe announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair.\n\nThe Sunday Times has reported that Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word \"dirty dossier\" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a \"catalogue of lurid allegations\" against him. \n\nThe paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it.\n\nNo-deal 'disorder' claim\n\nElsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal.\n\nNPCC operations lead Chief Constable Charlie Hall was responding to a Sunday Times report of a leaked document about police contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAccording to the paper, the document warned that concerns around medical supplies could \"feed civil disorder\", and that potential goods shortages raised concerns of \"widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder\".\n\nIt also warned that the \"necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility\" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU.\n\nMr Javid said he did not expect a no-deal outcome, adding: \"I'm glad the police and other experts are looking into this and thinking what might happen in a no-deal scenario.\"\n\n"

According to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), more than 130 countries already grant the Palestinians the rank of a sovereign state. \n\n'Unilateral steps'\n\nAn upgrade in status would allow the Palestinians to participate in General Assembly debates and improve their chances of joining UN agencies and the International Criminal Court (ICC), although the process would be neither automatic nor guaranteed.  \n\nIf they are allowed to sign the ICC's founding treaty, the Rome Statute, the Palestinians hope to take legal action in the court to challenge Israel's occupation of the West Bank.\n\nThe bid follows a failed attempt in 2011 by Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority and chairman of the PLO, to join the UN as a full member state. The proposal failed because of a lack of support in the Security Council.\n\nAs well as seeking to become a non-member observer state, the latest Palestinian resolution also calls for a Middle East settlement that \"fulfils the vision of two states, an independent, sovereign, democratic, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders.\" \n\nIsrael opposes any pull-back to the 1967 lines. \n\nIsraeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Ben Dor told the BBC earlier this month that President Abbas would be in breach of the Oslo peace accords if he continued to press for UN recognition.\n\nAnd he warned that if the Palestinians sought to ask the ICC to resolve disputes with Israel, then Israel would \"take unilateral steps to protect its interests\". \n\nHe did not elaborate on what those measures would be, but reports in the Israeli media suggested they might include halting the transfer of tax revenue to the Palestinian Authority and restricting the movement of Palestinian officials through the West Bank.\n\nPresident Abbas has said he does not \"want any confrontations with the United States or Israel\", adding: \"If we can start a dialogue or negotiations the day after the [UN] vote, we will.\"\n\nThe Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. However, two decades of on-and-off peace talks have failed.\n\nThe latest round of negotiations broke down in late 2010 over the issue of Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Attempts to restart direct talks have failed.\n\n"

There's not a joined up, consistent service.\"\n\nMajor trauma also went beyond road crashes \"people falling or being shot or stabbed\".\n\nHe added: \"A significant proportion are elderly patients with complex, pre-existing medical needs who have had what you might see as an innocuous fall or injury.\"\n\n"

        "text":"Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on 21 November 1974, killing 21 and injuring 220. \n\nA jury was sworn in earlier as the inquests reopened after a long fight by families.\n\nPaul Anthony Bridgewater and Michelle Sealey are among relatives attending.\n\nMr Bridgewater, whose father Paul Anthony Davies died in the bombings, said: \"The coroner has ruled out a lot of things but we want the truth really.\n\n\"We want the truth and we want to know what happened back then. It's been too long and there's that many theories out there and unanswered questions as well.\"\n\nCoroner Sir Peter Thornton said the jury of six women and five men had an \"important civic duty\" as he adjourned the inquests until Tuesday.\n\nThe individual inquests could last up to six weeks, the coroner said. The jury will return verdicts on how all victims died. \n\nThe hearings began with a minute's silence.\n\nSir Peter said the inquests would not deal with the issue of who planted the bombs, adding that was a \"task of police, prosecutors and the criminal courts\".\n\nHe said although a single hearing, lasting up to six weeks, the inquests would deal with \"21 separate people, 21 separate lives lost from two terrible events\".\n\nJurors, sitting at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, were told they would hear evidence from only a few eyewitnesses because some were \"no longer alive\".\n\nSir Peter added: \"They will be doing their best to recollect events accurately, but we all know memory will sometimes have gaps.\"\n\nHe said there would be details of the so-called \"forewarning issue\", and evidence the British authorities may have received information signalling the attacks, including an alleged tip-off concerning a \"possible conversation in a local prison nearly two weeks before\".\n\nJurors would also hear an account of \"evidence of a students' visit to a police station the evening of the bombings, which was cancelled\", Sir Peter said.\n\nMr Bridgewater said the loved ones of victims had formed close bonds. \n\nHe said: \"We are a like a close-knit family and that's what bonds us and keeps us strong.\"\n\nHis sister Ms Sealey added: \"It's the knockbacks that make you want to push forward even more because there is something there that we need to find out.\"\n\nInquests were opened days after the bombings but adjourned because the case was subject to a criminal investigation.\n\nThe Birmingham Six were jailed for the murders and served 17 years behind bars before their convictions were quashed.\n\nDespite the subsequent overturning of the verdicts, the inquests were never reopened. \n\nFresh inquests were ordered in 2016 but delayed because victims' families disagreed with the coroner, who ruled out naming those suspected of carrying out the bombings. \n\nBut the Court of Appeal in September upheld the coroner's decision. \n\nGeorge Jones, who lost his father John Clifford Jones, told the BBC he hoped the remit of the inquests would have been broader. \n\n\"It's an opportunity to answer a lot of questions but my own feelings and those of most of us is those avenues have been cut off by the coroner's decision of narrowing the scope,\" he said. \n\nPaul Bodman, whose father Stanley died, described the hearings as \"a tick-box exercise\". \n\n\"It's a stepping stone to see what we can get from this inquest and perhaps we can take it further,\" he said. \n\nHearings will continue on Tuesday and Wednesday with pen portraits of each of the victims, while on Thursday, the jurors will be taken to the former sites of the pubs.\n\nSir Peter is due to give his closing address on 28 March before the jury's deliberations start the next day. \n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Midlands correspondent Sima Kotecha \n\nToday marks a significant moment in this long running story.\n\nThese attacks on Birmingham happened more than four decades ago - and still the families of those killed have many unanswered questions.\n\nSome of them have fought with every ounce of their energy to have the inquests into the bombings reopened to try and establish some of the detail that has been missing.\n\nToday, the coroner will begin that process of attempting to fill some of the gaps - but will it be enough?\n\nAlready the scope of the inquests has been narrowed - and the crucial perpetrator issue will not be addressed so the families will not discover who was behind the killings.\n\nSo what will they learn over these weeks - and will it add anything new to what they already know, even though it may not be in the public domain?\n\nThe answer to the latter will assess the effectiveness of the process in their eyes.\n\nHowever, for the coroner and the courts, much sought after inquests taking place in the first place is likely to be viewed as a triumph.\n\nAmendment 14 March 2019: This story has been updated to reflect the most recent information that 220 people were injured in the blasts.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.\n\n"

Watching those iconic World War Two aircraft take to the skies above Biggin Hill was something to behold.

This seems concerning on many levels.\"\n\nUser habits\n\nHowever, she was reluctant to pinpoint a cause for the discrepancies, saying that to do so required \"further information about the inner workings of Google AdSense\".\n\nShe noted that one possible cause may be Google's \"smart\" algorithms - technology which automatically adapts advertising placement based on mass-user habits.\n\nIn other words, it may be that the search engines are reflecting society's own prejudices - as the advertising results Google serves up are often based on the most popular links previous users have clicked on.\n\n\"Over time, as people tend to click one version of ad text over others, the weights change,\" Prof Sweeney explained. \n\n\"So the ad text getting the most clicks eventually displays more frequently.\"\n\nShe argued that technology should be used to counteract this effect.\n\n\"In the broader picture, technology can do more to thwart discriminatory effects and harmonise with societal norms.\n\n\"Ads responding to name searches appear in a specific information context and technology controls that context.\"\n\n"

This is what we have learnt. \n\nThe rocket is enormous\n\nMany observers have been struck by the missile's vast size - this undated picture released by state media of Mr Kim dwarfed by the rocket he is inspecting gives an idea of its scale.\n\nMichael Duitsman, a research associate at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, noted that the missile was much bigger than its previous iteration the Hwasong-14, and added: \"Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club.\"\n\nSome have also noted that the rocket appears to have more sophisticated steering and thrusters.\n\nThe \"new, more capable missile\" seems to have a more powerful propulsion system with two main engines and looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant,  David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists told Reuters news agency.\n\nIt also has a larger and blunter nose cone, which could mean it can carry a \"super-large heavy\" nuclear warhead on its tip, as Pyongyang claims.\n\nAll this means that the missile appears capable of transporting a nuclear warhead for a long distance and possibly surviving atmospheric re-entry. North Korea claims that the Hwasong-15 is a viable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\n\nThere is a new transporter\n\nPhotos and videos also appeared to show the missile launching from a platform, and not from a mobile launcher which North Korea has used in previous missile tests. A large nine-axle vehicle transported the rocket to the site.\n\nAnalysts believe this arrangement was due to the missile's large size, and means it needs more time to launch.\n\nIn a situation when snap responses need to be made, \"this makes a big difference during crises,\" said NK Pro analyst Scott LaFoy.\n\nThe launch took place against a striking backdrop of a night sky filled with stars, with a noticeable but perhaps unsurprising absence of light pollution.\n\nIt was celebrated with cigarettes\n\nA jubilant Mr Kim is seen in many of the pictures, grinning as the rocket takes off. The missile's steep trajectory can be seen on screens in the background, apparently charted in real time.\n\nIt is believed to be North Korea's highest-ever missile, and Pyongyang said it achieved a height of 4,475km (2,780 miles).\n\nMr Kim and his coterie appeared to waste no time in celebrating the successful launch - with cigarettes.\n\nIt is not known how far away the viewing platform was from the launch site, but Mr Kim may have form in smoking in the vicinity of fuel-laden missiles - some believe this video from July shows him puffing on a cigarette right next to a Hwasong-14.\n\n"

        "text":"The US-brokered ceasefire had been announced in Washington on Sunday.\n\nTwo other ceasefires agreed earlier this month over the conflict were broken almost immediately. \n\nFighting erupted on 27 September around the mountainous enclave. The conflict has intensified again in recent days.\n\nThe \"humanitarian ceasefire\" was announced on Sunday in a joint statement released by the US, Armenian and Azerbaijani governments. \n\nIt came into effect at 08:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Monday.\n\nThe announcement followed discussions between US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov. The US state department said agreement was reached following intense negotiations.\n\nUS President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday to congratulate those involved.\n\nHowever, within minutes of the ceasefire coming into effect, Azerbaijan accused Armenian forces of shelling the town of Terter and nearby villages in \"gross violation\" of the agreement.\n\nArmenia's defence ministry said Azerbaijani artillery had fired on military positions in various parts of the front line after the ceasefire agreement had begun.\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan insisted his country \"continues to strictly adhere to the ceasefire regime\".\n\nHikmet Hajiyev, a spokesman for the Azerbaijani president, said Armenia was trying to \"preserve the status quo based on occupation\", adding: \"The Azerbaijani side is exercising restraint.\"\n\nRefugees watch and hope as fighting rages\n\nAt the scene: Olga Ivshina, BBC News, Barda, Azerbaijan\n\nSchools in the town of Barda are crowded but there are no lessons here. Schoolchildren are staying home because of the coronavirus outbreak and their classrooms are now occupied by refugees from the Terter region of Azerbaijan. Shelling there hasn't stopped since the first day of the fighting.\n\nOstagamed Isfandyarov, now living in the school with his family, proudly shows me his grandson's drawings of a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a machine gun and a rocket propelled grenade. \n\n\"Look at how precise the details are,\" he says.\n\nIn the pictures tanks and helicopters shoot at each other. These young boys are yet another generation growing up thinking war is just a part of life.\n\nAnd these are not the first families to have left everything behind. Thousands of Azerbaijani refugees from the first Karabakh war are still living in state-funded dormitories. \n\nConditions are pretty basic but for these refugees there is only one problem with where they have been living for the past 30 years - it isn't home. When I arrived I found them glued to the TV waiting for news about the villages and towns being taken by the Azerbaijani army. Finally, they tell me, this could be our chance to go home.\n\nMediators from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are also due to meet again on Thursday to discuss the conflict.\n\nTwo earlier ceasefires brokered by Russia have failed to hold. The president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, has also warned Russia not to get involved militarily in the conflict.\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan but is under ethnic Armenian control. \n\nClashes that began in the region in September quickly escalated into a large-scale conflict, with the shelling of towns and cities and the alleged use of banned cluster munitions. \n\nSeveral thousand people have died and shelling has killed civilians on both sides. Tens of thousands have fled their homes.\n\nMore on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict:\n\n"

Others said the Colombian state was \"a killer\" because of what happened to the 18-year-old student. \n\nThe protests started a week ago when trade unions and student groups convened a march attended by a quarter of a million people.\n\nTheir demands are wide-ranging and include calls for the government to drop a proposed tax reform and a thorough implementation of the peace agreement signed with left-wing Farc rebels in 2016. \n\nSince the death of Mr Cruz, protesters have added the demand for the dissolution of the riot police force Esmad to their demands.\n\nThe protest was not confined to the capital. There were also marches in Cali and other Colombian cities. \n\nMany of those taking part in rallies on Wednesday were young people demanding better access to education and employment. \n\n\"I'm marching so we 21 year olds can have the chance of a good job,\" Jean Carlo Hernandez told Reuters news agency. \"Dilan could have been me. We're facing a government that doesn't want to help young people move ahead even though we're the future,\" he added.\n\nThe marches of Wednesday were largely peaceful with members of the conservatory of music of the National University taking part playing their instruments while aerial artists and breakdancers also joined in.\n\nAfter meeting protest leaders on Tuesday, President Duque ruled out the dissolution of the riot squad, arguing it formed a key part of the security forces. \n\nBut the president said he shared protesters' urgency to get anti-corruption legislation passed.\n\nAll pictures subject to copyright.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n"

The courage to make your dream happen. The hard work to see it through.\n\n\"There's only one strategy for growth we can have now and that is rolling up our sleeves and doing everything possible to make it easier for businesses to grow, to invest, to take people on.\n\n\"Back small firms. Boost enterprise.

There's a mixture of relief and frustration amongst Conservative MPs from the South who are telling me he'd boxed himself in, left with no option but to abandon plans most of them supported.\n\nBut he can rightly claim he was rescued by growth in the economy. With new enterprise zones in Dorset, Hampshire and the Thames Valley, he is backing further growth, not least in new house building.\n\nHe's plotted a course to sell off mapmaker Ordnance Survey and a share of British air traffic control - both big employers in the South. And he's telling councils they can keep the cash from selling assets they own - from shops to farms to golf courses, as well as offering them a way to fund social care with a council tax rise.\n\n"

You can't wrap them up in cotton wool.\n\n\"I just want to make sure that the people selling alcohol are playing their part.\"\n\n"

        "text":"By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News\n\nWhat is contempt of court?  \n\nContempt of court laws exist to ensure people get fair trials. The idea is that juries must not be influenced by anything but the evidence they hear in court.\n\nThe rules apply to everyone from journalists to people posting comments on social media, and even jurors. \n\nIf someone interferes with a trial, the defendants can walk free and a new trial might have to be held.  \n\nThe maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years in prison, but it can also be punished with an unlimited fine. \n\nThe law is set out in the 1981 Contempt of Court Act.\n\nContempt includes publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing \"active\" criminal proceedings. Proceedings become \"active\" when a suspect is arrested. \n\nSomeone could also be in contempt by actions including taking photographs or film, recording what is said in court or talking to a jury member about a case. \n\nWhy was Tommy Robinson found guilty of contempt?\n\nTommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, committed contempt of court by broadcasting footage of defendants accused of sexual exploitation. The hour-long broadcast, outside Leeds Crown Court in May 2018, was seen by thousands of people.\n\nLawyers for the Attorney General said reporting restrictions had been put in place. These postponed the publication of any details of the case until the end of a series of linked trials, involving 29 defendants. This was to stop the juries in those cases being influenced.\n\nThey also said the manner in which Robinson filmed the defendants at court was a problem. The aggressive confrontation could have influenced those on bail not to co-operate with the trial.\n\nJudge Dame Victoria Sharp said when explaining the decision, that Mr Robinson encouraged \"vigilante action\" in his Facebook Live. She also said that the video could have \"seriously impeded\" justice over a sexual grooming gang's trial.\n\nRobinson was originally jailed for 13 months for the offence in May 2018. \n\nBut the Court of Appeal said his case hadn't been handled fairly. \n\nThen, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - the government's top legal adviser - announced that new proceedings could be brought against him.\n\nWhat other famous cases have there been?\n\nIn 2011, the Sun and the Daily Mail were found guilty of contempt for pictures they published during a murder trial. They had shown the defendant holding a gun, which risked prejudicing the jury.\n\nThe following year, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror were found guilty of contempt, following serial killer Levi Bellfield's conviction for the murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler.  \n\nTheir articles were part of an \"avalanche\" of bad character information about Bellfield, the hearing was told. \n\nThe Daily Mirror article detailed his violent treatment and sexual abuse of former partners, including Jo Collings. \n\nHowever, the jury still had to consider its verdict on an attempted abduction charge relating to another victim. \n\nThe coverage was considered prejudicial and the jury had to be discharged, denying the victim and her family the chance of justice.\n\nBellfield was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy.\n\nDoes it apply on social media?\n\nYes, discussions about court cases still need to stay inside the jury room. \n\nIn 2011, in the first case of its kind, juror Joanne Fraill was punished for contacting defendant Jamie Sewart via Facebook - causing a \u00a36m drugs trial to collapse. \n\nFraill was jailed for eight months for contempt for both contacting Sewart and searching online about the case. Sewart had already been cleared but other defendants were still on trial, so proceedings were compromised.\n\nSocial media users have been warned about commenting on court proceedings, and breaching restrictions put in place. Actress Tina Malone, for example, was given a suspended prison sentence for breaching an injunction protecting the identity of Jon Venables - one of James Bulger's killers.\n\nShe shared a Facebook message which was said to include an image and Venables' new name. \n\nWhat else counts as contempt of court?\n\nIntimidation: Juries must be able to give verdicts without being subject to abuse or intimidation.\n\nCarrying out research: In 2012, juror and university lecturer Theodora Dallas was jailed for six months for carrying out her own research about defendant Barry Medlock, who was on trial for causing grievous bodily harm.\n\nTaking or posting photos: In 2016, Damian Parker-Stokes was jailed for 15 months for taking photographs in court as his friend Ryan Sheppard was being jailed for murder. \n\nParker-Stokes posted one image on Sheppard's Facebook page with the words: \"Respect g at least u had the balls to admit it ...\"  \n\nThe then Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, said people who used Facebook to \"mock the administration of justice\" and \"cause considerable concern\" to a victim's family, \"must be deterred by the most severe sentences\".\n\n"

        "text":"By Reality Check teamBBC News\n\nReality Check looks into where the world's nuclear weapons are located and who owns them.\n\nWhile the global stockpile of nuclear weapons has shrunk significantly since the Cold War, there are hundreds of warheads that could be launched at short notice, and experts say every nuclear-armed nation is modernising its arsenal or has plans to do so.\n\nCountries keep most details of their nuclear weapons secret, but it is known that nine countries own the estimated more than 9,000 nuclear weapons that are in military service. These are either deployed - mounted on land or sea missiles and kept at air bases - or in storage. About 1800 are on high alert and could be fired with little warning. \n\nThe US and Russia own the vast majority of the world's nuclear weapons.\n\nIncluding retired warheads waiting to be dismantled, the total is said to be almost 15,000, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). This is a marked decline since the 1980s when the figure peaked at around 70,000. \n\nWhy only these countries?\n\nSince 1970, 190 countries including the US, Russia, UK, France and China have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). India, Israel and Pakistan never signed the agreement and North Korea left in 2003. The NPT recognises five states having nuclear weapons - US, Russia, France, UK and China - all of which had tested nuclear weapons before the agreement came into effect. \n\nUnder the agreement, these countries should not maintain an arsenal forever. \n\nThe treaty prohibits non-recognised states from developing nuclear weapons. South Africa, and former Soviet Union countries Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have all given up theirs.\n\nAre countries making progress on disarmament?\n\nThe US, UK and Russia have all been reducing the size of their warhead inventories, Israel's and France's are said to be relatively unchanged and China, Pakistan, India and North Korea are believed to producing more, according to the Federation of American Scientists. \n\nBut at the very least, experts say, every nuclear-armed state has plans in place to modernise its nuclear stockpile. \n\nModernisation is contrary to the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, says Shannon Kile, head of Sipri's nuclear project.\n\nThe UK is planning to replace its fleet of Vanguard nuclear armed submarines, which carries its Trident nuclear missiles. The overall size of its arsenal will be reduced to no more than 180 by the mid-2020s. \n\nThe US may spend more than $1 trillion (\u00a3703bn) by the 2040s upgrading its nuclear capabilities. Some of America's warheads can be found around Europe in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Turkey, which host around 150 warheads between them.\n\nNorth Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in September and the jury is still out on whether Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme is capable of attaching a warhead to a long-range missile. \n\nIn recent months, North Korea has demonstrated it has increasingly advanced missiles, which are said to have brought the United States within range. \n\nWill there ever be a nuclear-free world?\n\nA few months into his presidency, Barack Obama told a crowd of thousands in Prague that under his watch, America would commit \"to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\". It appeared as though the world edged closer in July 2017 when more than 100 countries endorsed a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons altogether. \n\nSo far dozens of countries have signed the legally binding instrument, the first agreement of its kind to explicitly ban nuclear weapons. However the nuclear-armed states boycotted the negotiations. \n\nThe UK and US say they never intend to join the treaty because it undermines the NPT. Allied Nato countries also failed to acknowledge the new agreement. \n\nThe International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), the organisation behind the treaty, was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWhat do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

        "text":"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News\n\nScientists have been trying to figure out how we are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come.\n\nTheir answer - \"the planetary health diet\" - does not completely banish meat and dairy.\n\nBut it is recommending we get most of our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) instead.\n\nTheir diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat. \n\nWhat changes am I going to have to make?\n\nIf you eat meat every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you're looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that's your lot. \n\nYou can still have a couple of portions of fish and the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of your protein will need to come from. The researchers are recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day instead. \n\nThere's also a major push on all fruit and veg, which should make up half of every plate of food we eat.\n\nAlthough there's a cull on \"starchy vegetables\" such as the humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa. \n\nSo what is the diet in detail?\n\nIf you served it all up this is what you would be allowed each day:\n\nThe diet has room for 31g of sugar and about 50g worth of oils like olive oil.\n\nHow do your food choices impact on the environment?\n\nDon't cry because you can't play with our interactive. \nUpdate your browser to have a go!\n\nHow do your food choices impact on the environment?\n\nYour results are below\n\nWill it taste awful?\n\nProf Walter Willet, one of the researchers who is based at Harvard, said no and that after a childhood on a farm eating three portions of red meat a day he was now pretty much in line with the planetary health diet.\n\n\"There's tremendous variety there,\" he said. \"You can take those foods and put them together in thousands of different ways. We're not talking about a deprivation diet here, it is healthy eating that is flexible and enjoyable.\" \n\nIs this for real, or just a fantasy? \n\nThis plan requires changes to diets in pretty much every corner of the world.\n\nEurope and North America need to cut back massively on red meat, East Asia needs to cut back on fish, Africa on starchy vegetables. \n\n\"Humanity has never attempted to change the food system at this scale and this speed,\" said Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, at Stockholm University. \n\n\"Whether it's a fantasy or not, a fantasy doesn't have to be bad... it's time to dream of a good world,\" she says.\n\nTaxes on red meat are one of the many options the researchers say may be necessary to persuade us to switch diets.\n\nWho came up with this?\n\nA group of 37 scientists from around the world were brought together as part of the EAT-Lancet commission.\n\nThey're a mix of experts from farming to climate change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their findings which have been published in the Lancet.\n\nWhy do we need a diet for 10 billion people?\n\nThe world population reached seven billion in 2011 and it's now around 7.7 billion. That figure is expected to reach 10 billion around 2050 and will keep on climbing. \n\nWill it save lives?\n\nThe researchers say the diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year.\n\nThat number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are now the biggest killers in developed countries. \n\nHow bad is farming for the planet?\n\nThe use of land for growing food and forestry accounts for around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's about the same as from electricity and heating, and substantially more than from all the trains, planes and automobiles on the planet.\n\nWhen you look more closely at the food sector's environmental impact, you can see that meat and dairy are the major factors. Worldwide, livestock accounts for between 14.5 and 18% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhen it comes to other warming gases, agriculture is one of the leading contributors to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions.\n\nAgriculture is also a significant source of air pollution with ammonia from farms a major cause of fine particulate matter, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is a threat to health worldwide. \n\nSimilarly when it comes to water, agriculture and food productions are one of the biggest threats, consuming 70% of global freshwater sources for irrigation.\n\nSo will this diet save the planet?\n\nThe researchers' aim was to feed more people while:\n\nHowever, just changing diets is nowhere near enough. \n\nTo make the numbers add up, also requires a halving of food waste and an increase in the amount of food produced on current farmland. \n\nWhy isn't meat being banned? \n\n\"If we were just minimising greenhouse gases we'd say everyone be vegan,\" said Prof Willet.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether a vegan diet was the healthiest option, he said. \n\nSo what happens now?\n\nThe EAT-Lancet Commission is going to take its findings to governments around the world and bodies such as the WHO to see if it can begin to change the way we eat. \n\nFollow James on Twitter\n\n"

        "text":"By Mervyn JessBBC News NI \n\nThe Belfast-built aircraft made the journey to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force's (RAF) 72 Squadron.\n\nTheir visit also coincides with the 30th anniversary of the basic trainer's first roll-out at the Shorts factory.\n\nThe stop is the last one on a centenary tour of airbases that have been home to 72 Squadron over the decades.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Chris Nash, who flew one of the Tucanos into Belfast, explained why it is painted in the Battle of Britain colours of the Spitfire, with Enniskillen written on the fuselage.\n\n\"It's to do with the way the Spitfires were financed for 72 Squadron during the Second World War,\" he said.\n\n\"A war fund was set up at that time and local communities raised money to help build a Spitfire, and that's why they got their name down the side of the aircraft.\"\n\nThe experienced jet pilot explained that he felt a sense of intimidation as a young pilot flying the Tucano, the RAF's basic training plane, for the first time.\n\n\"There's more power,\" he said.\n\n\"You sit in the front as a student with the staff officer behind you, whereas in previous aircraft it's side by side.\n\n\"You're wearing an oxygen mask, you're on an ejection seat and it all starts to feel far more military.\n\n\"It's quite challenging to fly but very rewarding once you get used to it and it will continue to be the RAF's basic trainer until  2019.\"\n\nWhen the Tucano was first rolled out at Shorts in east Belfast to great fanfare in 1987, the future of thousands of jobs depended on it.\n\nBut the launch day was not without controversy.\n\nSeveral hundred Shorts workers blocked a road outside the factory in protest at the presence of the then Northern Ireland secretary Tom King over the government's signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.\n\nSir Philip Foreman, the Shorts boss at the the time, was not impressed by those who took part in the protest, describing their actions as damaging.\n\n\"I'm sure what went on today will be seen around the world and it will certainly damage our business - it puts at risk 7,000 jobs,\" he said.\n\n\"But I don't think the people who did this sort of thing really understand the damage they are doing and I can't stress too strongly how irresponsible it is.\"\n\nIn spite of the concerns, the Tucano proved to be a success.\n\nThe RAF ordered more than 100 of the aircraft, which were built in a joint venture with the Brazilian aerospace company Embraer.\n\nFormer Shorts test pilot Paddy Crowther has his own memories of that time, particularly of one occasion when his engine cut out while flying over Rathlin Island.\n\n\"There is only one engine on the Tucano so it made for an interesting time - we had to divert to Machrihanish near the Mull of Kintyre,\" he explained.\n\n\"But apart from that it was very enjoyable to fly - even people like Prince William thought it was good.\n\n\"I spoke to his father Prince Charles about it at Hillsborough Castle once and they both thought the Tucano was excellent.\n\n\"Compared to other more sedate Shorts aircraft like the Skyvan, 330 and 360 passenger aeroplanes, the Tucano had a little more oomph to it.\"\n\nShorts has a history of successfully developing and building aircraft, both civil and military. including the World War Two Stirling bomber.\n\nThe Tucano is right up there with the best of them.\n\n"

One road in Brixton, South London, hit its permitted annual pollution level in five days. \n\nOwners of diesel cars - who were encouraged by previous governments to buy them as they were thought to be more economical and less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions - have expressed anger and confusion at the move.\n\nFormer Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax for diesel cars in 2001 - but there has been increasing concern that they emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to cause thousands of premature deaths in the UK. \n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan announced on Tuesday that from April 2019 there would be a \u00a312.50 charge - on top of the existing congestion charge - in central London for petrol cars that do not meet Euro 4 standards and diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 standards.\n\nAccording to City Hall, this will hit most petrol cars more than 13 years old in 2019, and diesel cars more than four years old in 2019.\n\nIn 2015, former Labour science minister Lord Drayson said Tony Blair's government made a mistake in promoting diesel cars because they were now \"killing people\". \n\nMotoring organisations have said diesel car drivers are being \"punished\" for following a previous government's policy. \n\nAnd Mrs May has now hinted there will be schemes to help drivers who were told that diesel vehicles were the right purchase.  \n\nSpeaking on her trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, she said: \"Decisions will be taken when we produce that [air quality] plan.  \n\n\"But I'm very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we look at what we do in the future.\"\n\nShe did not set out any specific plans, but there have been reports of a scrappage scheme that could pay people to get rid of their diesel vehicles. \n\n"

We will change our model, and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged.\"\n\n'Extremely risky'\n\nAsked about Mr Hammond's comments during an interview on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn said \"He appears to be making a sort of threat to EU community saying 'well, if you don't give us exactly what we want, we are going to become this sort of strange entity on shore of Europe where there'll be very low levels of corporate taxation, and designed to undermine the effectiveness or otherwise of industry across Europe.'\n\n\"It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. That really isn't a very sensible way forward.\"\n\nMr Corbyn also said Mrs May \"appears to be heading us in the direction of a sort of bargain basement economy\", adding: \"It seems to me an extremely risky strategy.\"\n\nMore like Singapore?\n\nby BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam\n\nAccording to Philip Hammond, Britain might be \"forced\" to change its economic model. To what?\n\nFor some, the true advantage of leaving the EU would be to tear up the 'rules' and make Britain more like Singapore.\n\nSingapore abides by World Trade Organisation and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade rules, but it's famed for its light touch regulation - especially when it comes to financial services - which some Brexiteers feel is the opposite of EU \"meddling\".\n\nBut turning a large G7 economy with a robust social model into a city state might be difficult. It might involve the government handpicking which industries it thinks will be successes and rapidly neglecting existing sectors.\n\nMillions of people would need to get brand new qualifications while those with undesirable skills would become surplus to requirements. Massive infrastructure projects might be rushed through with minimal consultation.  \n\nFor a country with Britain's past and present, is that a possible future?\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it appeared Brexit would mean a \"low-tax, deregulated race to the bottom\", with workers' rights and environmental protections threatened.\n\nShe wrote on Twitter: \"If that is the case, it raises a more fundamental question - not just are we in\/out EU, but what kind of country do we want to be?\"\n\nIn her speech on Tuesday, the prime minister is expected to call on the country to \"put an end to the division\" created by the EU referendum result.\n\nShe will urge the UK to leave behind words such as \"Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain\".\n\nSeveral of Sunday's newspapers claim Mrs May will outline a \"hard Brexit\" approach, a term used to imply prioritising migration controls over single market access.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not think it was a \"binary choice\" between trade and migration, but added that the \"very stark message\" from the EU referendum was that \"free movement as it exists today cannot continue in to the future\".\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said a \"hard Brexit\" had not been on the ballot paper in June's referendum and accused the PM of adopting \"the Nigel Farage vision\" of Brexit.\n\nMr Farage, the former UKIP leader, told Sky News he had \"yet to be convinced\" by the PM's approach.\n\n"

        "text":"His departure will bring an end to the latest chapter in an eventful career that has brought him fame, riches - and some notoriety.\n\nEvans built his reputation as a witty prankster on London station GLR, where he started as a producer and ended up as a star DJ.\n\nHe shot to fame in 1992 as host of The Big Breakfast, a riotous early morning programme on Channel 4.\n\nThe Big Breakfast was a huge hit in its early days, beating even GMTV when it launched on ITV in 1993.\n\nThe Warrington-born star's dynamic personality defined the show, which catapulted him from cult personality to national celebrity.\n\nDon't Forget Your Toothbrush, his first prime-time TV show, made its debut on Channel 4 in 1994.\n\nThe format for the show - made by Ginger Productions, his own production outfit - was lucratively sold around the world.\n\nAfter leaving The Big Breakfast in 1994, Evans was recruited by BBC Radio 1 to revamp the station's breakfast show.\n\nHe accepted on the proviso it would be in the hands of Ginger Productions, an arrangement the BBC was prepared to accept in return for bumper ratings.\n\nIn 1996 he returned to Channel 4 to launch TFI Friday, a classic Evans cocktail of live music, celebrity chat, outlandish stunts and in-jokes.\n\nYet he found it hard to juggle it with his Radio 1 day job, leading to a parting of the ways in January 1997 when his demands to work a four-day week were refused.\n\n\"I was stupid, no doubt about that,\" he admitted in 2009. \"I was ungrateful. I had this brilliant career and messed it up.\"\n\nEvans was not off air for long. Later that year he returned to breakfast radio, on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin station.\n\nHe liked the job so much he bought Virgin Radio from Sir Richard at the end of 1997.\n\nBut the Evans magic started to fade soon afterwards.\n\nHe was photographed out on the town with Paul Gascoigne, damaging the footballer's chances of getting into the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. \n\nTFI Friday started to go off the boil, while two BBC projects, the National Lottery-based Red Alert and student quiz Carry On Campus, flopped.\n\nThat did not stop him selling his Ginger Media Group to the Scottish Media Group (SMG) for \u00a3225 million in early 2000.\n\nYet things soon turned sour at Virgin. Evans failed to turn up for a week of breakfast shows and the station ignored his claim that he had been ill. \n\nPhotographs and footage had emerged of him out drinking with pop star Billie Piper, prompting Virgin to dismiss him. \n\nEvans said the termination of his contract cost him \u00a33 million in lost share pay-outs. Yet he ultimately lost his case against his former station.\n\nHe and Piper married in 2001 and moved to Los Angeles. But their union did not last and they divorced in 2007.\n\nEvans would eventually return to the BBC in 2005 to present afternoon shows on Radio 2.\n\nAfter moving to Drivetime in 2006, he was named as Sir Terry Wogan's successor in the coveted breakfast slot in 2009.\n\nThe following year he moved back to prime-time television by co-presenting BBC One's The One Show on Friday evenings.\n\nEvans went on to become one of the BBC's top earners, with figures last year revealing he brought in between \u00a32.2m and \u00a32.25m.\n\nThis was partly due to him co-hosting BBC One's Top Gear following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.\n\nEvans, a well-known petrolhead and experienced broadcaster, was seen as a safe bet to take over the helm of the BBC's flagship motoring show.\n\nYet ratings plummeted, and the presenter was forced to apologise for an ill-advised stunt filmed around a monument to Britain's war dead.\n\nEvans left Top Gear after one series, concentrating instead on his Radio 2 show and his two children with third wife Natasha Shishmanian.\n\nOne of the show's most popular initiatives is 500 Words, a story-writing competition for children now in its eighth year.\n\nEarlier this year Evans revealed that he and Natasha, a professional golfer and columnist, were expecting twins.\n\nSpeculation is mounting over who will replace him now he has chosen to bring the curtain down on his 13 years at Radio 2.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

A similar vote in 2008 was narrowly defeated.\n\nIn England, the issue is due to be discussed again in November. \n\nDespite female bishops being allowed in Northern Ireland and Scotland, none have been elected yet.\n\nThe vote at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in Lampeter, Ceredigion, led to huge cheers as the result was announced.\n\nBut it has also led to some traditionalists saying the decision may lead them to consider their future within the Church.\n\nCanon Jenny Wigley, Rector of Radyr, whose successful amendment to the bill was instrumental in ensuring the vote had a yes or no outcome, said she hoped women in the Church of England would be encouraged by the result.\n\n\"Sisters across Offa's Dyke, look to us,\" she said.\n\n'Promise'\n\nThe vote leaves the bishops to write a code of practice for those who cannot \"accept the authority of women bishops\". \n\nDr Morgan said: \"I hope it will be possible that no-one will be lost. It's a matter now for discussion. \n\n\"I promise on behalf of the bench of bishops that we will talk to a range of people across the Church.\n\n\"We'll come back in April to hear what people have to say but in the end the bishops will have to draw up the code of practice.\"\n\nIn the breakdown of the vote, the laity voted 57 for, 14 against, with two abstentions; the clergy section saw 37 voting for and 10 against, while the bishops voted unanimously in favour.\n\nRetired Father Alan Rabjohn, a traditionalist and chairman of Credo Cymru (Forward in Faith Wales), said: \"There is still a lot to be dealt with. \n\n'Different world'\n\n\"The bishops said they would care for us. That sounds to me like 'we'll look after this lot until they die out'.\n\n\"We are not going away. We are here like our brothers and sisters who believe in women bishops,\" he told BBC Radio Wales.\n\n\"They have now got to really start talking to people. Not telling us what we need for terminal care but asking us what we need to go on living alongside our brothers and sisters and proclaiming the gospel.\n\nOne of those who spoke against, Dr Elliott King, said he was still hopeful differences could be overcome.\n\n\"Personally I'm disappointed that the bill has passed but we have a great opportunity now over the next 12 months to work together to find a way forward for us all to stay within the Church.\"\n\nThe Venerable Peggy Jackson, Archdeacon of Llandaff, Cardiff, who proposed the amendment with Canon Jenny Wigley, said: \"This morning I wake up in a completely different world.\"\n\nShe said yesterday's vote \"was the day discrimination against women came to an end\" but added that people from both sides of the argument had to live together.\n\n\"The important thing is to live together in graciousness and gentleness.\"\n\n"

There are eight checks involved. It is rigorous.\"\n\nShe said procurement \"had to be done at speed, because in early stages of the pandemic we didn't have enough PPE inside the country.\n\n\"The government believes that the beginning of the pandemic we had to act very quickly and we were very successful at that.\"\n\nShe added that all public contracts would be published \"in the fullness of time\". \n\n'Shadow state'\n\nDuring her speech, Ms Reeves also called on ministers to end emergency procurement rules brought in at the start of the pandemic, which have streamlined the normal bidding process for contracts. \n\nShe said \"bad practices\" introduced at the start of the crisis had worsened, with contracts for protective equipment becoming an \"unseemly gold rush\". \n\nShe urged ministers to publish \"all outstanding contracts\" by the end of the month, and for the Freedom of Information Act to cover all new public service contracts outsourced to private firms.\n\nShe also criticised in the government's record in recovering money from firms that have failed to deliver services adequately or on time. \n\n\"The corporations running so many public services hide behind 'commercial sensitivity'. A shadow state has emerged and it is unaccountable to the people,\" she said. \n\nAs well as a new Integrity and Ethics Commission, she called for an \"independent anti-corruption and anti-cronyism commissioner\" to oversee how money is spent.\n\nShe argued these measures would \"clean up government contracting\" and make the UK a \"world leader in good governance\".\n\n"

        "text":"Changes are being made to the weight and height at which a child will be allowed to use a backless booster seat. However, parents will not need to replace car seats they have already bought because they can continue to use them.\n\nWhat is changing?\n\nFrom next year, changes are being made on the rules regarding backless booster seats.\n\nCurrently, parents can use these types of seats for children who weigh 15kg (2st 5lbs) and above - typically aged three and over.\n\nThe new rules will mean only children weighing over 22kg (3st 7lbs) who are also over 125cm (4ft 1ins) tall can use the seats.\n\nThe United Nations, which sets the safety standards for car seats, has approved the change which must now be implemented by the EU.\n\nThe government said the earliest the new rules will come in is March 2017 and they will affect the whole of the UK.\n\nWhy bring in the new rules?\n\nMany child car seat experts say they are unsuitable for small children as the child is not held as securely in the seat, the adult seatbelt is not guided across their body in the best way and they offer little protection if a car is involved in a side-on crash.\n\nWhat if you have already bought one?\n\nDo not worry. The changes will only apply to new backless seats and not ones already on the market that meet current safety standards.\n\nParents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a new one.\n\nIt will be down to manufacturers of new seats to ensure they meet the revised safety standards and are labelled correctly.\n\nWhat is the current law?\n\nChildren must use a child car seat until they are 12 years old or 135cm (4ft 5in) tall, whichever comes first.\n\nThere are typically three types of children's car seats:\n\nOnly EU-approved child car seats can be used in the UK - which have a label showing a capital \"E\" in a circle.\n\nParents should typically choose a car seat based on their child's height or weight.\n\nA driver can be fined up to \u00a3500 if a child under 14 does not wear a seat belt or child restraint. Anyone 14 and over not wearing a seat belt must pay the fine themselves.\n\nThere are exceptions. For example, children can travel without a child car seat in a taxi or minicab if they travel on a rear seat and wear an adult seat belt if they are aged three or older or without a seat belt if they are under three.\n\nWhich seat should you have?\n\nMany parents think they can judge which car seat they need to buy based on their child's age but it should only be used as guidance. \n\nCar seats are typically categorised according to height and weight. \n\nHeight-based car seats, known as \"i-Size\" seats, must be rear-facing until the child is over 15 months old.\n\nFor weight-based car seats, the type depends on how heavy a child is.\n\nA more detailed list is available through childcarseats.org.uk\n\n"

It also said that it could face litigation-related expenses of another $6.8bn.\n\nIt is currently in talks with the Justice Department over a potentially huge settlement, related to the mis-selling of mortgage related products during the US housing boom.\n\nIt is thought the settlement could cost as much as $11bn.\n\nMr Dimon stressed on Friday that much of the case related to deals done by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, companies that JP Morgan Chase bought during the financial crisis.\n\n\"The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues and one that recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the US government,\" he said.\n\nLast month, JP Morgan paid $920m to settle a case related to disastrous trades by Bruno Iksil, who earned the nickname the \"London Whale\" for his big bets on the financial markets.\n\nLast year, the bank admitted to losses of $6.2bn resulting from his activities.\n\nAs part of the settlement deal, JP Morgan admitted violating US federal securities laws.\n\n"

Inside the courtroom he rose to reject the charges, before departing within 45 minutes while his lawyers continued deliberations.\n\nWhat is Benjamin Netanyahu accused of?\n\nMr Netanyahu has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000:\n\nMr Netanyahu has consistently denied all the charges against him, branding them a \"witch-hunt\" by political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name. \n\nHow can the PM serve and stand trial at the same time?\n\nAccording to Israeli law, a leader charged with a crime is not required to resign. But there is no precedent.\n\nA former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as party leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained prime minister until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power.\n\nWhat does the trial mean for the country?\n\nIn short, a serving prime minister occupying the most powerful office in the land simultaneously trying to clear his name and avoid jail-time.\n\nIt comes just six weeks before Israelis go to the polls in what is expected to be a close-fought election. \n\nWhile Mr Netanyahu's own Likud party has stood behind him, political opponents have tried to maximise the prime minister's legal difficulties, claiming he is unfit to hold office.\n\nMr Netanyahu has though previously successfully fought three elections since criminal investigations into him began in 2016.\n\nEven if he is convicted and is still in power, Mr Netanyahu will not be required to resign unless and until any appeals are exhausted - which could, in theory, be many months or years into the future.\n\nIn Ehud Olmert's case, the former prime minister went on trial in 2009 and after he was convicted only began serving his sentence in 2016 due to the long legal process.\n\n"

Charging hubs have been springing up at festivals and in eastern European capital cities. One landlady in Norwich has even had her  television unplugged by a pesky patron.\n\nThe hot spell in London and the south east of England last summer saw a significant rise in sales of portable chargers for mobile phones. They even made it into court when one of those jailed for looting during the London riots was found to have been delivering a phone charger to a friend.\n\nIn some ways, shorter battery life is pushing us to revert to our pre-mobile phone ways where we agreed in advance to meet at a set time and place. Jeff Parsons, news editor at technology magazine T3, says the charger provides a temporary solution to a problem which manufacturers have been unable to solve.\n\n\"These new devices run even more processes and have newer features that in turn use up valuable power. A bright display, push notifications and Bluetooth connectivity are some of the biggest power drains on a modern smartphone. \n\n\"In fact, when used to their full potential, few smartphones are able to last longer than 24 hours without a recharge. Ultimately, no-one wants to be left with a dead phone at a crucial time so it's hardly surprising that many people choose to play it safe and bring a phone charger with them when they travel.\"\n\nThe option of a plug socket, or \"power point\", is now marketed by train companies when booking tickets for a long-distance journey. But our insatiable thirst for electricity for our gadgets has also thrown up questions of its own. Should you plug in at work? How much does this cost businesses each year? Is it acceptable to sit next to a public plug socket and not use it, thereby stopping someone else? \n\nSo next time you sit down in a cafe, be wary of your choice of seat - somebody wanting power may well be watching with envy.\n\nFollow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook\n\n"

We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus.\"\n\nMs Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to \"look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult\".\n\nFollowing the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring \"internal assessment window\" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April.\n\nThis was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelled in 2021.\n\nChief executive Philip Blaker said: \"We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon.\"\n\nMr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. \n\nPolice 'will continue to crack down on rule breakers'\n\nSpeaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. \n\nSince the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. \n\n\"Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,\" he added.\n\n\"I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all.\"\n\nWhat's the reaction been to the school announcement?\n\nUnions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff \"had to be a priority\", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began.\n\nCurrently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition.\n\nLaura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a \"properly organised\" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open.\n\n\"Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,\" she said.\"Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: \"I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system.\"\n\nWhat do opposition parties say?\n\nOpposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a \"digital divide\".\n\nPlaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: \"The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff.\"\n\nWelsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning.\n\n\"This is another bleak day for education in Wales,\" she said.\n\n\"Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open.\"\n\nShe tweeted: \"Get a grip on consistent online quality. Give my vaccination to a younger teacher.\"\n\n"

        "text":"Bayer said the bid was an \"extraordinary opportunity to create a global agriculture leader.\" \n\nMonsanto is primarily known for genetically modified crops, often leading to vocal activist criticism. \n\nLast week, news of the deal angered Bayer investors, with one describing it as \"arrogant empire-building\". \n\nThe offer marks the biggest ever bid by a German company, dwarfing the Daimler's $38.6bn acquisition of Chrysler in 1998. \n\nJohn Colley, a Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, said it was an unusual approach for a German firm, which he said typically opted for lower risk expansion.\n\n\"The Bayer bid is clearly designed to leave the board of Monsanto with little room for manoeuvre. The large cash bid means - despite Monsanto's dislike of European ownership - they will appear as though self interest is prevailing if they reject it. \n\n\"Few megabids go well and research shows more than half destroy value, and only around a quarter deliver on their promises,\" he said.\n\nBayer's farm business produces seeds as well as compounds to kill weeds, bugs and fungus, but it is better known for its healthcare products such as Asprin and Alka-Seltzer.\n\nAnalysts said if the deal went through, almost half of the merged firms' business would be agriculture, a mix likely to displease investors who had bought shares in Bayer for its pharmaceutical offering.\n\nBayer's shares, which fell 8% when the merger talks were announced last week, fell 3% in early trading.\n\nThe offer comes amid a wave of mergers in the industry. \n\n'Perfect match'\n\nRivals Dow Chemical, DuPont and Syngenta have all announced tie-ups recently, although they have yet to be cleared by regulators.\n\nThe drop in commodity prices has put pressure on firms such as Monsanto, with farmers' cutting orders for supplies.\n\nBayer said the offer of $122 per share represented a 37% premium on the price of Monsanto shares before rumours about the takeover bid emerged in the media. \n\n\"Monsanto is a perfect match to our agricultural business. We would combine complementary skills with minimal geographic overlap.\n\n\"At the same time, ongoing consolidation activities in the industry make this combination by far the most attractive one,\" Bayer's chief executive Werner Baumann said in a statement.\n\nHe said he was confident that the Monsanto board would accept the offer, saying \"we fully expect a positive answer\".\n\nBoth companies had confirmed last week that they were in talks over a possible deal. \n\nIndustry mergers\n\nBayer has a market value of about $90bn, making it the second-largest producer of crop chemicals after Syngenta.\n\nMonsanto, which has a market capitalisation of $42bn, attempted to buy Swiss rival Syngenta last year.\n\nHowever, Syngenta ended up accepting a $43bn offer from ChemChina in February, although that deal is still being reviewed by regulators in the US.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful bid, Monsanto announced plans to cut 3,600 jobs by the end of next year in a massive restructuring.\n\nBayer's acquisition of Monsanto is expected to be bigger in value than the ChemChina-Syngenta deal.\n\nThe biggest merger in the chemicals industry took place late last year when Dow Chemical teamed up with Du Pont to form a new $130bn company. \n\n"

ensuring that no planning permissions or environmental permits are granted for these developments - could equally be applied to underground coal gasification.\"\n\nMary Church, head of Campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, claimed UCG was the \"most experimental and frightening method of unconventional gas extraction currently threatening Scottish communities.\"\n\nShe also said recent trials around the world had gone \"badly wrong\", and described the climate impact of the technology as \"simply unacceptable\".\n\n\"It makes no sense for a country with ambitious climate targets and the means to achieve them with renewables to flirt with such a risky form of energy production.\" she added.\n\n\"Communities threatened with Cluff's plans to ignite the coal under the Forth are asking why hasn't the Scottish government acted to protect them in the way that communities facing shale gas fracking and coal bed methane drilling are. \n\n\"The case to include underground coal gasification in the new moratorium and planned work on health and environmental impacts of unconventional gas is crystal clear, and the means of doing so totally within the power of the Scottish government.\"\n\n'Appropriate controls'\n\nIn response, the Scottish government said its \"careful, considered and evidence-based approach\" had been underpinned by the recent moratorium announcement, which outlined its plans for a full public consultation and further research.\n\nA spokesman said: \"The moratorium is specifically about onshore unconventional oil and gas developments, including fracking - further to confirmation by the UK government that it would devolve onshore licensing powers for these types of development. \n\n\"Many of the relevant powers relating to underground coal gasification remain with Westminster and the licensing regime is not being devolved, though we will work with Sepa and all relevant regulators to ensure we have the appropriate controls and regulations to protect the environment.\n\n\"The Scottish government will continue to take an evidence-based approach to the development of new energy technologies, which should give security and confidence to the people of Scotland that such resources would be developed in an environmentally safe and satisfactory way.\"  \n\n"

It will take the continued commitment of energy, initiative and investment if we want to compete with the increasingly powerful top Asia-Pacific universities and the best of Europe and America.\n\n\"We are ambitious for a Scottish higher education sector truly excellent in world terms, not just truly excellent when compared to the rest of the UK.\"\n\nThe Times Higher Education World University Rankings employ 13 separate performance indicators, which it says makes it the only world rankings to examine all the core missions of the modern global university - research, teaching, knowledge transfer and international activity.\n\n"

Earlier on Thursday Dixons Carphone said the appetite for new phones was pretty weak currently - one reason worried investors marked the shares down by about a fifth.\n\nDixons Carphone said customers are choosing to hang on to their existing smartphones for four to five months longer, and it is partly because Apple's most recent iPhone is not seen as appealing enough.\n\niPhone 7 apathy\n\n\"For half the market, the Apple base more or less rejected the iPhone 7,\" said Dixons Carphone chief executive Seb James. \"We have a much bigger iPhone 6 base - we have many customers holding on to the iPhone 6S even if the battery is on its last leg.\"\n\nI'm an Apple fan myself, and I'm in the same boat as Mr Silver. I love my iPhone 6S, and while Tim Cook might think Apple had \"courage\" when it decided to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, I - like many others - disagree.\n\nI've had my iPhone 6S for almost two years, and I still love it. I'm eligible for an upgrade on contract, but why would I want one, when the phone I have now is just fine?\n\nBut even those whose phone is on its last legs still won't upgrade to the iPhone 7.\n\nAsher Silver's phone has a hole in its corner, but he would rather just get another iPhone 6S.\n\nGrowing concern\n\nEven those on the iPhone 5 - launched half a decade ago - are not in a great rush to upgrade.\n\nCopywriter Kate Fairman, 26, says it's too expensive: \"I've had my iPhone 6S for two months. Before that I had an iPhone 5S. I kept it for a long time because I couldn't afford a new phone and I had to wait to get an upgrade.\"\n\nDixons says price is a growing concern and people are not upgrading their phones as frequently because the handsets themselves have risen in price. \n\nAlthough investors in Dixons Carphone were clearly spooked by the poor picture painted of mobile phone sales, chief executive Mr James is optimistic that the number of mobile phone contract packages will soon go up, because no phone will last forever, and few people want to pay the full price of a smartphone upfront.\n\nOf course, the depreciation of the pound hasn't helped matters either, as the iPhone is priced in dollars, and the pound buys fewer dollars than it did before the Brexit vote. \n\nThat currency effect has also pushed up the cost of Samsung in the UK.\n\nWindsor Holden, head of forecasting and consultancy at Juniper Research, says: \"People are hanging on to their phones for longer.\"\n\n\"There's also been a slight increase in prices of high-end handsets. That will in turn have an impact on affordability.\"\n\nEnd of cool?\n\nIn 2015 when the iPhone 6S was launched, there was a mad rush for gold and rose gold iPhones among the Instagram set, as the device was considered to be the \"must have\" accessory of the season. \n\nAlthough the iPhone is still popular with core Apple fans, overall, the pop culture prestige of owning a smartphone is starting to die out, according to experts. \n\n\"If you take a developed market with a high penetration of iPhones, the coolness factor has gone down, because everyone already has a premium smartphone, compared to four or five years ago,\" says Roberta Cozza, a research director at Gartner.\n\n\"Overall, the sense of smartphones being a fashion accessory has diminished. \n\n\"Lifecycles have extended on smartphones. It's harder to sell a premium flagship device because users will not buy unless they see a meaningful difference to their daily experience.\"\n\n"

But we will know more in the next two decades from ground based and space based telescopes.\n\n\"Technological developments in the last two decades and the future make it possible in principle within a generation.\"\n\nProf Hawking is backing a project by Mr Milner's Breakthrough Foundation, a private organisation funding scientific research initiatives that government funders think to be too ambitious. \n\nExpert group\n\nThe organisation has brought together an expert group of scientists to assess whether it might be possible to develop spaceships capable of travelling to another star within a generation and sending information back. \n\nThe nearest star system is 40 trillion km (25 trillion miles) away. Using current technology it would take about 30,000 years to get there. \n\nThe expert group concluded that with a little more research and development it might be possible to develop spacecraft that could cut that journey time to just 30 years. \n\n\"I'd have said that even a few years ago travel to another star at that kind of speed would not be possible,\" said Dr Pete Worden, who is leading the project. He is chairman of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation and a former director of Nasa's Ames Research Center in California.\n\n\"But the expert group figured out that because of developments in technology there appears to be a concept that appears to work.\"\n\nThe concept is to reduce the size of the spacecraft to about the size of a chip used in electronic devices. The idea is to launch a thousand of these mini-spacecraft into the Earth's orbit. Each would have a solar sail. \n\nThis is like a sail on a boat - but it is pushed along by light rather than the wind. A giant laser on Earth would give each one a powerful push, sending them on their way to reaching 20% of the speed of light.\n\nIt sounds like science fiction but Yuri Milner, who was named after Yuri Gagarin by his parents, believes that it is technically possible to develop these spacecraft and get to another star within our lifetimes.\n\n\"The human story is one of great leaps,\" he said. \"Fifty-five years ago today, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. Today, we are preparing for the next great leap - to the stars.\" \n\nChallenging work\n\nThere are many problems to be overcome before the first spaceships capable of going to other stars are built. These include miniaturising cameras, instruments and sensors so they fit on a chip, developing a solar sail strong enough to be blasted by a powerful laser for several minutes and find a way to get pictures and information of the new star system back to Earth. \n\nProf Sir Martin Sweeting, who is a researcher at the Surrey Space Centre and head of Surrey Satellite Technology in Guildford, wants to be involved in the project. \n\nHe founded a company 30 years ago that reduced the size and cost of satellites.\n\n\"A lot of what we did in the 1980s was considered very wacky  but now small satellites are considered all the fashion. This (project to go to another star) is currently a wacky sounding idea but technologies have moved on and now it is not wacky it's just difficult,\" he told BBC News.\n\nProf Andrew Coates of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, which is part of University CollegeLondon, agreed that the project would be challenging, but not impossible. \n\n\"There would be significant difficulties to solve such as ruggedisation for the space radiation and dust environment, instrument sensitivity, interaction of the high power accelerating laser with the Earth's atmosphere, spacecraft stabilisation and power provision. \n\n\"But it is a concept worth looking at to see if we could really reach another star system within a human lifetime.\"\n\nBut Prof Hawking believes that what was once a distant dream can and must become a reality within 30 years. \n\n\"There are no greater heights to aspire to than the stars. It is unwise to keep all our eggs in one fragile basket,\" he told BBC News. \n\n\"Life on Earth faces dangers from astronomical events like asteroids or supernovas\". \n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter\n\n"

        "text":"By Tessa WongBBC News, Singapore\n\nIn recent weeks, many European nations have issued advisories to wear a mask in certain public settings, and in England the latest advice is to wear a face covering in \"enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible\", such as public transport and some shops.\n\nSeveral US states have also given similar advice, and even the White House now makes it compulsory for all staff to wear face masks - though President Donald Trump still refuses to wear one.\n\nMany people are still not wearing masks despite official advice though, and some governments remain unconvinced about the science.\n\nWhy some people embrace masks while others shun them is not just about government directives and medical advice - it's also about culture and history, a debate over evidence, and even about personal liberties.\n\nThe official word on face masks\n\nSince the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the official advice from the World Health Organization has been that only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are suspected to have the coronavirus.\n\nNobody else needs to wear a mask, and experts have given several reasons for that.\n\nOne is that a mask is not seen as reliable protection as other methods, given that current research shows the virus is spread by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. So it could protect you, but only in certain situations such as when you're in close quarters with others where someone infected might sneeze or cough near your face. This is why experts say frequent hand washing with soap and water is far more effective.\n\nRemoving a mask requires special attention to avoid hand contamination, and it could also breed a false sense of security where you end up ignoring or forgetting to practice good hygiene.\n\nYet in some parts of Asia everyone wears a mask by default - it is seen as safer and more considerate.\n\nIn mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, the broad assumption is that anyone could be a carrier of the virus, even healthy people. So in the spirit of solidarity, you need to protect others from yourself.\n\nSome places take this idea very seriously: in some parts of China, you could be arrested or punished for not wearing a mask. In Singapore, which used to discourage citizens from wearing masks, it's now compulsory to wear one outside or risk a fine of S$300 (\u00a3170, $210).\n\nMeanwhile in Indonesia and the Philippines, where there are suspicions that there are many under-reported cases, most people in major cities wear masks to protect themselves from others.\n\nFor many of these countries, mask-wearing was a cultural norm even before the coronavirus outbreak. They've even become fashion statements - at one point Hello Kitty face masks were all the rage in the street markets of Hong Kong.\n\nIn East Asia, many people are used to wearing masks when they are sick or when it's hay fever season, because it's considered impolite to be sneezing or coughing openly.\n\nThe 2003 Sars virus outbreak, which affected several countries in the region, also drove home the importance of wearing masks, particularly in Hong Kong, where many died as a result of the virus. So one key difference between these societies and Western ones, is that they have experienced contagion before - and the memories are still fresh and painful.\n\nIn some parts of Asia, seasonal air pollution or heavy traffic pollution in crowded cities have also made it pretty normal for people to wear masks outside.\n\nThe mask as a social nudge\n\nSome argue that ubiquitous mask wearing, as a very visual reminder of the dangers of the virus, could actually act as a \"behavioural nudge\" to you and others for overall better personal hygiene.\n\n\"Putting on a mask every day before you go out is like a ritual, like putting on a uniform, and in ritual behaviour you feel you have to live up to what the uniform stands for, which is more hygienic behaviour like not touching your face or avoiding crowded places and social distancing,\" said Donald Low, a behavioural economist and professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nThen, there's the idea that every little bit counts in the war the world is waging against the virus.\n\n\"We can't say if face masks are ineffective, but we presume they have some effect because that's the protection we give to healthcare workers,\" said Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist with Hong Kong University.\n\n\"If face masks are used on a lot of people in crowded areas, I think it would have some effect on public transmission, and at the moment we're looking for every small measure we can to reduce transmission - it adds up.\"\n\nBut there are down sides of course. Some places such as Japan, Indonesia and Thailand have faced shortages, and South Korea has had to ration out surgical masks.\n\nThere is the fear that people may end up re-using disposable masks, which is unhygienic, or use inferior masks sold on the black market. Japan and Singapore have since given out reusable masks to its citizens.\n\nPeople who do not wear masks in these places have also been stigmatised, to the point that they are shunned and blocked from shops and buildings.\n\nIn Hong Kong, some tabloids have splashed pictures on their covers of Westerners not wearing masks and congregating in groups in the city's nightlife district, and criticised expatriates and tourists for not taking enough precautions.\n\nBut the discrimination works both ways.\n\nIn places where mask wearing is still not the norm despite government advisories, those who do wear masks have been shunned or even attacked. It hasn't helped that many of these mask wearers are Asians.\n\nIn the US, it's become an issue of personal freedoms, with some arguing that making everyone wear face masks infringes on civil liberties. The city of Stillwater in Oklahoma was forced to soften a mask law to an advisory after threats of violence, while a Michigan security guard was killed after he barred a shopper who didn't have a mask from entering a store.\n\nBut those societies that do advocate everyone wearing a mask may have a point and increasingly, experts are now questioning the official WHO advice.\n\nUndocumented cases\n\nFirstly, there is some emerging evidence that there are more \"silent carriers\", or healthy people with the virus who show little or no symptoms, than experts initially thought.\n\nIn China, it is estimated that a third of all positive cases show no symptoms, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post.\n\nOn the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, about half of the more than 600 positive cases found onboard were found to have no symptoms.  A similar proportion of asymptomatic cases has been reported in Iceland.\n\nThe prevailing belief has been that because these people do not exhibit symptoms, they are not very contagious. But some are questioning this now.\n\nA recently published study of cases in China found that \"undocumented cases of infection\", or those with either mild or no symptoms, were significantly contagious and could have been responsible for nearly 80% of positive virus cases.\n\nMeanwhile a Hong Kong study estimates that up to 44% of virus transmission from an infected person can happen before that person starts showing any symptoms.\n\nSo does that mean if everyone wore a mask, these silent carriers wouldn't turn into spreaders?\n\nThe jury is still out on this issue, with various studies proving and disproving the effectiveness of a mask in stopping transmission of the coronavirus.  This is why some places have so far held back from mask laws and advisories, such as New Zealand which successfully controlled its outbreak and is holding back on advising citizens to wear masks because of the lack of scientific consensus and clinical trials.\n\nResearch is ongoing, and future studies will no doubt add nuance to the overall picture.\n\nThe face mask may be a product of recent history, experience with contagion, and cultural norm. But as this pandemic evolves, along with evidence and research, our behaviour may change again.\n\nAdditional reporting by Helier Cheung\n\n"

In the end, freedom is unconquerable. No wall can survive the will for freedom in the long term. The violence of just a few has no hold over the drive for freedom of many.\"\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel, who also attended the event, was herself raised in the East.\n\nThe number of people who died trying to cross the Wall is disputed - at least 136 are known to have been killed but victims' groups say the true number is more than 700.\n\nThe first victim was thought to be Guenter Litfin on 24 August 1961 and the last Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989.\n\nA list of names of the victims was read out overnight.\n\nAlthough the Wall came down in 1989, it remains for some a symbol of continuing economic division between the richer west and poorer east.\n\nInvisible barrier\n\nBrigitta Heinrich, a schoolteacher by profession, grew up in Klein-Glienicke, which was unusual in that it was an East German enclave on the territory of West Berlin.\n\nSpeaking to Russian news agency Ria-Novosti, she said one of her own pupils had escaped across the Wall in the early days, using a ladder. \n\nThe schoolboy's parents were forced to move out of Klein-Glienicke as a result, and the mother was sacked from her job in a company, she said. \n\nRecalling the hardships and broken illusions of the communist state, Ms Heinrich, who still lives in the East, also talked of the difficulty of readjusting to a unified country.\n\nShe said she had made friends with other Europeans such as Italians and Finns since the fall of the Wall but some West Germans, especially in regions further away from Berlin, seemed indifferent to people from the former East, as if an invisible barrier remained.\n\n\"I cannot name a single West German with whom I socialise now - really, I can't,\" she said.   \n\nFew parts of the Wall remain, though city authorities have laid down an 8km (five-mile)row of cobblestones to mark its path.\n\nTourists often struggle to find original sections.\n\n"

Less than two months later, Formby caused a stir when he got engaged to Pat, the 36-year-old daughter of a family friend.\n\nThe couple planned to marry the following year, but Formby died from a heart attack in Preston at the age of 56 before they could do so. \n\nThe newly-discovered collection includes Pat's diaries covering nine years. The entry for Monday 6 March 1961 has written in the corner: \"4.00pm George RIP.\" The entry for that Friday says simply: \"George's funeral.\"\n\nAn estimated 100,000-150,000 people lined the streets of Liverpool to pay their respects when his funeral was held.\n\nThe suitcase also contains a mounted letter dating from 1939, relaying how members of the royal family had been \"completely convulsed with laughter\" while watching Formby's films including It's in the Air.\n\nThere are both Beryl and Pat's passports, photos and negatives of George and Pat together, and of George on film sets, and photos of Beryl as a child, when she was a champion clogdancer.\n\nAfter he died, Formby's estate was at the centre of a court battle between Pat - who was the main beneficiary of his will - and the star's mother and three sisters.\n\nCaroline Stewart, chairwoman of the George Formby Society, said of the find: \"Anything that's got a direct link to George is exciting.\n\n\"Also, the little period after Beryl's death when George and Pat Howson got engaged - there's not a lot known about that because it was such a brief period, so there's a bit of insight there.\"\n\nIn June 1961, Pat sold the contents of George and Beryl's house in a three-day auction held in a marquee in the grounds. Virtually everything was sold - even his underpants.\n\nReferring to the possessions in the suitcase, Ms Stewart said: \"They must have come from the house - they must have been saved from the sale.\"\n\nGeorge and Beryl didn't have any children, and Pat was childless when she died in 1971 at the age of 46. Mr Felton is now hoping to sell the collection.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Vesta's irregular form is now unmistakeable.  In the images, one pixel corresponds to 45km on Vesta's surface.  \n\nIn the days since 1 June, Vesta has started to acquire pictures with resolutions of around 30km per pixel - slightly better than the best shots we have from the Hubble Space Telescope.  \n\n\"This is really a new world which we've never seen before, so it should be very exciting,\" said Dr Andreas Nathues from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany which processed the imagery.\n\n\"We will have five times Hubble resolution by the beginning of July,\" he told BBC News.\n\nThe asteroid has the look of a punctured football, the result of a colossal collision sometime in its past that ripped a big chunk out of its south polar region (the five o'clock position).\n\nThe debris from that smash-up was sent far and wide. About one in every 20 meteorites that falls on the surface of the Earth is probably a bit of Vesta.\n\nCeres and Vesta will make for interesting subjects. They are both evolved bodies - objects that have heated up and started to separate into distinct layers.    \n\nIn the case of Vesta, telescopes have spied evidence for the eruption of lava (basalt) on its surface.  \n\n\"The goal is to acquire the first colour pictures of Vesta in early July,\" said Dr Nathues.  \"We will go into three different kinds of orbits and the last of these will be about 200km in height from the surface. The best resolution at that stage will be about 20m per pixel.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n\n"

He called on the police to investigate. \n\nDUP MLA Keith Buchanan, who represents the Mid-Ulster area, told BBC News NI's Inside Politics programme that several members of the community in Bellaghy had sent him images of the crowd at the game.\n\nHe said he was not raising it as a political issue but one of personal responsibility and added that others would pay the price for the behaviour of the crowd, which he described as \"out of control\".\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Linda Dillon told the programme that she had not seen the images but that if regulations have been broken then it should be looked at.\n\nHowever, she paid tribute to the role local GAA clubs had played during the pandemic. She said she was sure the GAA would look at the scenes from the weekend and take a responsible attitude.\n\nSDLP MLA Patsy McGlone also said he had not seen the images but that if there had been any braches then the Public Health Agency (PHA) should liaise with the GAA and investigate. \n\nIn a statement, Mid Ulster Council said it \"would emphasise the need for everyone to behave responsibly\". \n\nA spokeswoman for the council said that \"enforcement responsibility lies with the PSNI\", and had previously called for people to follow guidance after Covid-19 guidelines appeared to be breached at a match involving Dungannon Clarkes.  \n\nPolice have said they are investigating a GAA match in County Tyrone on Sunday 20 September to see whether Covid-19 regulations were breached.\n\nFollowing the match, crowds came onto the pitch, leading to concerns about social distancing.\n\nThe council added it called on everyone to adhere to \"the regulations and guidelines which are there to protect us all, especially as cases are rising\".\n\nWhat are the rules about fans in a stadium? \n\nSporting events are omitted from rules that limit outdoor gatherings to 15 people, and some spectators are allowed - but within strict restrictions.\n\nUnder guidelines issues by the Department for Communities, spectators are required to be two metres apart..  \n\nA crowd management plan should be in place too, with a one-way system to avoid congestion as spectators enter and leave a stadium. \n\nWhere possible, ticketing and booking should be used, to allow for social distancing within seated venues. \n\nA specific maximum number of spectators allowed is not given by the department. \n\nInside Politics Mid Ulster Q&A will be available to watch on the BBC News NI website from Monday evening and is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster at 06:00 on Tuesday,\n\n"

        "text":"By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent\n\nThe explosions killed at least 140 people, mostly civilians, and injured over 500. \n\nMore than four days on since the attack - which was widely reported to have been an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition - the Saudi authorities have yet to publicly accept responsibility.\n\nThe UK, which has a long-standing and lucrative defence and trade relationship with Saudi Arabia, has taken the unusual step of requesting \"oversight\" of the ongoing investigation into the attack.\n\nWill this be enough to dampen the growing condemnation of US and British military support for the Saudi campaign? Unlikely.\n\nTobias Ellwood MP, the Foreign Office minister for the Middle East and the man who has to periodically stand up in Parliament to defend Britain's arms sales to the Saudis, is due to hold sensitive talks with Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel Jubair as well as the Yemeni president and the UN Special Envoy for Yemen. \n\nAt stake is more than just an explanation of how such a horrific death toll was incurred in a single attack at the weekend. \n\nFor the UK, this is also about the whole nature and rationale of its controversial strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia, which campaigners want immediately curtailed. \n\nUnsuccessful war\n\nIn March 2015 Saudi Arabia went to war in Yemen at the head of a coalition of 11 countries. \n\nIts aim was to reverse the takeover of the country by Houthi rebels, who are supported by Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran, and to restore the UN-recognised President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his government to power. \n\nArmed with state-of-the-art US and British warplanes and their munitions, Saudi Arabia's air force and its allies have complete air superiority in the skies over Yemen, meaning they alone can carry out air strikes. \n\nThese have failed to dislodge the Houthis from the capital Sanaa and from much of the heavily-populated west of Yemen. \n\nThe damage inflicted on civilians has been catastrophic. The UN blames the air strikes for causing 60% of the estimated 4,000 civilian deaths. \n\nThe Houthis are far from blameless. They and their allies among the forces loyal to the ousted Yemeni leader Ali Abdullah Saleh are accused of shelling densely populated areas, laying mines indiscriminately and contributing to the humanitarian crisis that now afflicts the country. \n\nThey have also embedded themselves in the civilian population, exposing non-combatants to the risk of attack. \n\nRound after round of peace talks have failed to reach a compromise deal between the Houthis and the legitimate - but now deeply unpopular - Yemeni government which clings to a corner of land around the southern port of Aden. \n\nCeasefires have been announced, and then quickly fallen apart.\n\nWar crimes?\n\nThe Foreign Office is at pains to point out that Britain is not a part of the Saudi-led coalition. \n\nBut the fact is that British and US military hardware is sustaining the Saudi campaign and Yemenis know it. The US also provides intelligence and refuelling for the coalition. \n\nEven before Saturday's bombing of the funeral hall there were accusations that Saudi Arabia's air strikes in Yemen constituted a breach of the Geneva Convention and were possibly war crimes. \n\nThe Saudis insist they abide by a strict code, the Law of Armed Conflict, and have never deliberately targeted civilians, a claim disputed by many Yemenis. \n\nThe Saudis also undertake to investigate allegations that its warplanes have killed civilians through an 11-nation body called the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT). \n\n'Criminal judging his own crime'\n\nAnd hereby lies the problem.  The Saudis say the JIAT operates to exactly the same high standards as similar investigations carried out by US and other Western militaries. Although the JIAT has admitted to some targeting errors, several of its members are the very same countries that are part of the Saudi-led coalition. \n\nHence the jibe on social media that their findings carry as much weight as \"a criminal judging his own crime\". Hence Britain's request to have what it calls \"oversight\" (the Saudis prefer to call it \"assistance\") into this latest incident. \n\nDefence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said if it transpires that civilians were knowingly targeted last Saturday then the UK \"could review\" its defence relationship with Saudi Arabia. \n\nThe Saudis have promised total transparency. That, in theory, should reveal who, if anyone, gave the order to bomb the funeral, knowing that senior Houthi rebel leaders would be present, and crucially whether or not they knew that large numbers of civilians would be hit. \n\nThe Foreign Office minister's talks on Thursday could be uncomfortable for all sides.\n\n"

Venture Capitalists, the joke goes, will fund anything as long as it is within one hour's drive from Sand Hill Road, where many of Silicon Valley's venture capital (VC) firms are clustered.\n\nSo much for humour, but anecdotal evidence suggests that for start-ups outside the United States it is indeed much more difficult to find the money to get their venture off the ground.\n\nBut if this week's  \n          \n \n          Innovate Israel conference\n, held in London, is anything to go by, that situation is improving. \n        \n\nTake Israeli start-up Wibbitz. One click - and your paragraph of text is turned into a lively video, as the firm's software collates images and stitches them together on the fly; no editing required.\n\nJust recently, the Tel Aviv-based company managed to secure its first major investment of $2.3m (\u00a31.5m), from a UK branch of a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm Horizons Ventures.\n\n\"A few years ago, the only VCs that invested in Israeli companies were local Israeli VCs or a branch of US VCs, based in Israel,\" says Yotam Cohen, Wibbitz's co-founder, sitting in a crowded room full of Israeli and British entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.\n\n\"Now, I do see a trend in Israel that companies are searching for other markets, and the UK is a very interesting one.\"\n\nEncouraging innovation\n\nYossi Vardi, an Israeli investor called by many the godfather of Israel's hi-tech industry, says UK investors are realising that Israel is becoming \"recognised world over as a hot bed for innovation\".\n\n\"We now see large UK companies coming to Israel to source technology and to make investments,\" he says.\n\nBut British venture capitalists believe it is more due to a change in the financial and regulatory culture in the UK itself.\n\n\"The UK has become a much more attractive place for start-ups in general, whether they're UK start-ups or Israeli start-ups, because the [current] government is taking a much more active approach to encouraging start-ups,\" says Toby Coppel from a British venture capital firm Virgin Green Fund.\n\n\"In the UK, it's cool to be a start-up now - having a corporate job used to be the thing to do, but now everyone's talking about start-ups.\"\n\nRichard Anton, from Amadeus Capital Partners, agrees.\n\n\"The UK government is clearly trying to establish the country as a technological hub and that means partnering with the best in the world - and in places like the US and Israel the provision of technology is enormous\".\n\nA lot has been made of Tech City, also known as \"Silicon Roundabout\" in London's East End. In November 2010 the UK government said it wanted to turn the area into a world-leading technology hub.\n\nCurrently more than 1,000 start-ups crowd the place and big tech firms have been attracted too.\n\nIn March, Google opened a Google Campus there, a building full of desk space and ready-made infrastructure for young tech companies - Google mentoring included. \n\nTowards the UK\n\n\"The UK is definitely more present on the start-up map now, the entire innovation eco system is picking up here, including VCs,\" says Ido Yablohka from Israel's Clarity Ray, a firm that works with website owners to generate alternative, \"unobtrusive and user-friendly\" ads to users who have blocked regular advertising pop-ups.\n\n\"For Israeli entrepreneurs specifically, I think London is extremely well-based in terms of the European market, because of the financial conditions, the language and the location.\n\n\"The European market is something that would be silly to ignore, it's very significant - and the UK government is providing strong support [for London to become the main tech hub in Europe].\"\n\nTVTak is an Israeli start-up that came straight to the UK to find a partner - without looking elsewhere.\n\nThe company promises to make your television interactive - through smartphone apps that allow viewers to interact with programmes or commercials they are watching on the big screen. \n\nPoint the camera of your mobile device at the TV screen, the app \"recognises\" the content and directs you to the right webpage.\n\n\"In the UK, we did a campaign with Walkers, where people would point at a TV commercial and get an exclusive clue about the flavour of the potato chips shown on the screen,\" says TVTak's chief executive David Amselem.\n\nViewers were then taken to a Facebook sweepstakes page, where whey could guess the flavour and win a prize.\n\nLocal start-ups\n\nThe hi-tech community around \"Silicon Roundabout\" may be booming and foreign entrepreneurs may be flocking to the UK in search of investors and partnerships, but many British start-ups still find it hard to secure the right kind of funding.\n\nThey have to look elsewhere, either going the traditional route, to Silicon Valley, or as far away as Chile. A government programme there, called Start-Up Chile, offers aspiring entrepreneurs from around the world funding for six months to kick-start their project.\n\nIan Ozsvald from Brighton, co-founder of an artificial intelligence firm Strongsteam, says he tried for months to get funding in the UK, but failed.\n\nTogether with his fianc\u00e9e Emily Toop, who heads her own start-up Tiny Ears, a firm specialising in speech recognition for children, he got the crucial first investment from the Chilean government.\n\n\"I'm getting married in a year's time, so I will be going back to the UK, but if the funding situation there doesn't change, I will have to look for money in other places,\" he says.\n\nBut for Israeli entrepreneurs, at least those that came to Innovate Israel this week, the UK seems to be becoming one of the main destinations to come get money - and get noticed.\n\n"

        "text":"The ballot at the National People's Congress unanimously approved Mr Xi while Mr Wang received 2,969 votes in favour and only one against.\n\nWang Qishan was previously in charge of corruption investigations in China.\n\nHe is a longstanding ally of President Xi and his elevation is being seen as a further consolidation of the Chinese leader's power.\n\nThe recent abolition of term limits for the Chinese presidency extends to the vice-presidency, giving the position greater significance than before.\n\nChina's constitution allows the vice-president to \"assist\" in his superior's work and to carry out presidential duties on his behalf - meaning Wang Qishan, possibly in his role for life, could be far more than the figurehead his predecessors were.\n\nWho is Wang Qishan?\n\nMr Wang, 69, has held a number of prominent positions since starting work for the Chinese Communist Party in the 1980s as a policy researcher.\n\nHe became mayor of Beijing during the Sars outbreak there in 2003, and was executive chair of the city's Olympic committee ahead of the 2008 games.\n\nIn 2007, he joined China's Politburo and in 2009 became then-president Hu Jintao's chief negotiator in trade talks with the US.\n\nFormer US treasury secretary Henry Paulson described him at the time as \"decisive and inquisitive\", and possessing a \"wicked sense of humour\".\n\nHowever, Mr Wang is best known for his most recent post - leading China's anti-corruption investigation.\n\nThe campaign, controlled by Mr Wang as head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, was launched in 2012 under the then newly appointed party leader, Xi Jinping.\n\nDuring President Xi's first five years in office, 1.34 million officials at high and low levels - people Mr Xi disparaged as \"tigers and flies\" - were brought down by corruption and disciplinary charges.\n\nMr Wang, reportedly a friend of Mr Xi's from their youth, led the charge - becoming a feared enforcer for the Xi administration.\n\nWhat does his promotion mean?\n\nThe end of term limits and the choice of such a prominent party member as Mr Wang could mean a change in what the role represents, analysts say.\n\nMr Wang's experience negotiating with the US on economics is significant, given US President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs.\n\nHua Po, an independent Chinese political commentator, told AFP news agency his appointment may be to allow Mr Wang and Mr Xi to combat President Trump, adding: \"Maybe they'll be able to come up with a solution for this massive brewing storm with America about imbalances and tariffs.\"\n\nAnd his closeness to President Xi could mean he will make the position his own.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times, researcher Wu Qiang who was formerly at the Tsinghua University in Beijing, said Mr Wang is \"one of the most important figures\" in President Xi's administration.\n\n\"Wang Qishan will add substance to the role of vice-president,\" he said. \n\n\"The amendment of the constitution has raised the status of the presidency, and the vice-presidency will also benefit from that.\"\n\n"

        "text":"People in Birmingham, Sandwell and Solihull are banned from meeting others who are not part of their household or support bubble, in homes or gardens. \n\nThe restrictions affect about 1.6 million people and run alongside wider rules that came into force on Monday.\n\nThe council is asking the government for an exemption to rules around child care after parents raised the issue.\n\nMichelle McDaid, from Solihull, who relies on her parents to help with childcare, said the rules were \"frustrating\".\n\nDr Justin Varney, from Birmingham City Council's public health department, said: \"This... prevents family members providing childcare, and that is having significant impact on lots and lots of families.\"\n\nMr Varney said while they were not seeing any \"clear evidence of spread within schools\", the social side was causing transmission of the virus.\n\n\"Multiple children have gone to the same birthday party and are testing positive and that's leading to three or four bubbles in the same school having to be sent home to isolate,\" he said.\n\nWest Midlands mayor Andy Street warned people they must comply with new restrictions or face even tougher measures.\n\n\"We will use these restrictions, look at how the numbers move, and if they are not sufficient, we might have to go further,\" Mr Street said on Sunday. \n\n\"Everybody now has to comply with these to give us the best chance.\"\n\nUnder the new rules, people are banned from meeting others who are not in their household or support bubble, indoors or in private gardens. \u00a0 \n\nPeople can still go out to shops, restaurants and other venues, in a maximum group of six from more than one household, but the council told people to be \"vigilant\". \n\nWest Midlands Chief Constable Dave Thompson said he understood it had been a \"tough time\", but urged people to act responsibly. \n\nHe said officers would aim to \"educate and encourage compliance\" with the restrictions and would focus efforts on \"disrupting flagrant breaches, such as large gatherings\".\n\nAnalysis\n\nby Kathryn Stanczyszyn, BBC Radio WM political reporter\n\nChildcare is one of the big issues of these new restrictions.\n\nWith a combination of people going back to work from furlough and schools facing Covid-related closures the last thing families need is the absence of grandparents too.\n\nThat's why all three councils are sending a letter to government asking for special exemptions for those who have essential childcare from family members. \n\nNo other area has received one yet, so it's far from guaranteed. In fact, it's believed the government originally wanted to be even stricter - so putting in place more caveats could be unlikely. \n\nBut with no clue of how long these rules will be in place, it's seen as one small solution in an increasingly complex picture when it comes to keeping the virus at bay.\n\nFigures show the rate of cases per 100,000 in Birmingham to the week to 11 September was 82; for Solihull the figure was 71.2; and Sandwell stood at 64.2.\n\nProf Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, said the testing situation in the city was similar to the rest of the country.\n\n\"I think you almost have a perfect storm... events have come together to almost essentially crash the testing system,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of Wolverhampton Council, Ian Brookfield, advised residents not to mix households and to follow the guidance given to people in Birmingham, Sandwell and Solihull.\n\nMr Brookfield said \"new evidence\" from the test and trace teams at the council showed 90% of all transmission is \"home-related\".\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But Christmas is not going to be normal, there's absolutely no question about that.\n\n\"We are not going to be in large family groupings, with multiple families coming round - that is fiction for this year.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that if we can get numbers down to a certain level we may be able to get some form of normality. But people should get their digital Christmas ready.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon has previously insisted it was too early to plan for Christmas, saying it was too soon to tell what impact restrictions are having on the spread of the virus.\n\nThe government will publish guidance this weekend about how families should celebrate Halloween, with Ms Sturgeon saying: \"It is not safe right now to do these things as normal.\"\n\nThe first minister said that the more people stuck with the rules \"the more chance there is\" of a more normal festive period, but said government had to be \"honest and straightforward\" with people.\n\nShe added: \"Some of the really tough additional things governments are doing right now with extra restrictions are also in part about trying to deal decisively with an upsurge in the virus now, so we give ourselves the best chance of greater normality at Christmas.\n\n\"Christmas this year for no country anywhere is going to be absolutely normal and without any restrictions. I could do what politicians would do in normal times and try to tell you otherwise, and let people down nearer the time, but that's not the right approach right now.\n\n\"We are not likely to be able to celebrate Christmas with no limits on how many people we have in our homes and on what we do.\"\n\nShe said that the \"best chance of getting as much normality over the Christmas period as possible is for all of us to abide by these restrictions and all the guidance right now\".\n\nMs Sturgeon added that any restrictions would not prevent Santa from delivering presents to children on Christmas Eve, describing him as a \"key worker\".\n\n'Huge sacrifices'\n\nFollowing Prof Leitch's comments, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the government must allow an open public debate if it \"expects months more of sacrifices\".\n\nHe said: \"People have made huge sacrifices for months on end, they will be devastated to hear that Christmas as they know it is cancelled this year. \n\n\"Many will rightly question whether the government have used the past six months as well as they could have to expand testing, shore up our NHS and prepare for a second wave.\"\n\nScottish Conservative public health spokesman Brian Whittle said \"clear and concise communication\" was important in controlling the virus.\n\nHe said: \"We have to be realistic and accept that this Christmas very probably won't be normal, but that's a different thing from suggesting that families might only be able to get together online. \n\n\"When the public are so desperate for information, it's vital that every minister and official chooses their words carefully.\"\n\n"

        "text":"Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) Union have walked out for 48 hours over plans to close all ticket offices at a cost of 960 jobs.\n\nTransport for London said 50% of services were running compared to about 40% during the last walkout.\n\nThe strike is due to end at 20:59 BST on Wednesday but disruption may continue into Thursday morning.\n\nThe union and London Underground (LU) have met more than 40 times through the arbitration service Acas since the last 48-hour strike in February, but talks broke down on Monday.\n\nLU has said it plans to run as many services as possible, supplemented extra bus and river services, but customers are advised to check their journey before they travel.\n\nServices running at the moment, all with a reduced frequency and with a number of stations closed, are:\n\nWhere services were being operated, trains began to run at about 07:00 and will finish at about 23:00. The last services from central London may also depart much earlier, at about 21:30. \n\nTfL said about 87% of Oyster cards that would usually be seen on the network have been used and there were almost 8,000 buses on the roads - the most ever operated in London - after an extra 266 were put into service.\n\nThese included 40 vintage buses including the green AEC (Associated Equipment Company) Regent Mark III built in the 1950s.\n\nAnd it said there has been a 70% increase in Barclays cycle hires.\n\nTfL as a whole wants to save \u00a34.2bn by 2020. The plans to close ticket offices are expected to save \u00a350m a year. \n\nThe RMT said it would have suspended the strike if LU had agreed to a public consultation over the plans, which do not include any compulsory redundancies. \n\nThe acting general secretary of the RMT union, Mick Cash, described the strike as \"solidly supported\" and accused London Underground of backtracking on an earlier deal to review its plan to close ticket offices.\n\n\"They're looking to make \u00a350m worth of cuts and to do that they want to get rid of every single booking office and 1,000 jobs,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"Now we took industrial action in February this year and we suspended it following a deal done with our former general secretary, Bob Crow, where they had promised to review every single station. \n\n\"And there are over 200 stations and, do you know, what we've done is five.\"\n\nBut the managing director of London Underground, Mike Brown, told Today: \"We agreed that we would start by looking at the different station types, which group into five different types, and we'd look at those first.  \n\n\"And now we're in the midst of doing the full station by station review starting with the Piccadilly Line.  \n\n\"So I'm afraid what you've heard from Mick Cash is nonsense.\"\n\n'Farcical'\n\nMayor of London Boris Johnson said the idea it was a solidly-supported strike was \"farcical\" and repeated there would be no compulsory redundancies.\n\nHe added: \"This action is the result of a minority of just one union, the RMT, who are refusing to see the logic of what we are trying to achieve.\n\n\"We can't, as some would have us do, just stand by and force Londoners to pay for ticket offices. \n\n\"A resource which currently costs Londoners money, and where less than 3% of journeys begin, can be delivered better and far more efficiently with these changes.\"\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron tweeted: \"It's unacceptable that millions of people are having their lives disrupted by today's Tube strike in London.\"\n\nThe strike is likely to hit university students taking degree exams. On its website, King's College London says it is aware of students' concerns and will review the impact of strike action.\n\nEmployers' organisation the CBI said the strike was likely to have had a \"limited impact on the wider economy\".\n\nNeil Carberry, director for employment and skills, said: \"Employers make it possible for staff to work remotely.\n\n\"However, there will understandably be a significant impact on those businesses where that has simply not been possible.\"\n\nThe RMT is also holding a 48-hour strike which began at 03:00 on Tuesday on the Heathrow Express in a separate row over jobs, pay and cuts.\n\nAnd football fans travelling to Chelsea's Champions League match with Atletico Madrid at 19:45 on Wednesday will also be affected.\n\nThe union is set to strike for 72 hours from 21:00 on Monday, 5 May if the ticket office dispute is not resolved. \n\n"

I wish Richard Leonard well for the future.\"\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the sacking of Mr Sarwar and Ms Baillie showed that Labour is \"more divided than ever\", and claimed the party had \"deliberately removed their best performers from the front bench\" as part of a \"bewildering and ridiculous political fiasco\". \n\n"

        "text":"The activist, 44, was led away by police at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport.\n\nThousands had gathered at a different Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted.\n\nMr Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year. The Kremlin denies any role.\n\nThe opposition politician's allegations have however been backed up by reports from investigative journalists.\n\nNews of Mr Navalny's detention prompted condemnation from the European Union, France and Italy, which called for his immediate release.\n\nUS President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser echoed the call. \"The Kremlin's attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,\" Jake Sullivan said.\n\nHow did events unfold?\n\nWhen Mr Navalny was poisoned last August and collapsed on an internal flight in Siberia, he was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia. \n\nOn Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. \n\nThe plane was packed with journalists, including Andrey Kozenko of the BBC Russian Service. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for \"technical reasons\", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers.\n\n\"I know that I'm right. I fear nothing,\" Mr Navalny told supporters and the media upon landing, just minutes before he was detained. \"Have you been waiting for me long?\" he asked border guards.\n\nHe kissed his wife Yulia - who had flown with him from Germany - after police officers warned they would use physical force if he disobeyed their orders to come with them. Despite pleas, Mr Navalny's lawyer was not allowed to accompany him.\n\nThe activist is being held at a police station in Moscow.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, extra riot police were deployed and metal barriers erected inside Vnukovo airport, where the plane was originally scheduled to land.\n\nRussian media reported that a number of activists - including key Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol - had been detained.\n\nWhy was Navalny detained?\n\nIn a statement late on Sunday, Russia's prison service said the opposition leader \"had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period\". It added that he would remain in custody until a court decision.\n\nThe authorities accuse him of violating conditions imposed after a conviction for embezzlement, for which he received a suspended sentence. He has always said the case was politically motivated.\n\nSeparately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation.\n\nThe activist earlier argued that Mr Putin was doing all he could to stop him from returning to Russia by fabricating new cases against him.\n\nThe Russian authorities often make out that Alexei Navalny isn't popular with the Russian people, that he's no threat to President Putin. \n\nBut his return home five months after being poisoned sparked a major police operation on Sunday.\n\nIn chaotic scenes, riot police pushed Mr Navalny's supporters out of the arrivals hall of Vnukovo airport, before the flight was rerouted.\n\nLast summer, Russia's most prominent opposition figure was attacked in Siberia allegedly by an undercover hit squad of Russian security agents.\n\nHis decision to return home is a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin - and creates a dilemma for the Kremlin.\n\nIt risks turning him into a political martyr, a Nelson Mandela-like figure, and sparking more Western sanctions. \n\nDo nothing and the Kremlin's fiercest critic will almost certainly be a thorn in its side in an important election year.\n\nWhat happened to Navalny last year?\n\nIn August, he collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The pilot diverted the flight to the city of Omsk, where Mr Navalny was admitted to hospital. Two days later, Russian officials allowed him to be airlifted to Germany in an induced coma for specialised treatment. \n\nEuropean experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War.\n\nHe was released from a hospital in Berlin in September to continue his recuperation. \n\nMr Navalny said recently he was able to do push-ups and squat exercises, and therefore had probably almost fully recovered. \n\nLast month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years.\n\nMr Navalny then duped an FSB agent named Konstantin Kudryavtsev into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation which he recorded and posted online.\n\nThe agent told him that the Novichok used to poison him had been placed in his underpants. \n\nPresident Putin has dismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groups that have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as \"a trick\". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services.\n\n"

These women will not have reported to the police the fact that they have been raped. The volume is so incredibly profound that we have an epidemic in this country.\"\n\nThe debate follows a Women and Equalities Committee hearing last month where schools minister Nick Gibb admitted current guidance does not stop children who sexually abuse other pupils being put back in the same classroom as their victim. \n\nHowever Mr Gibb said this situation should not happen and said the Keeping Children Safe in Education guidance could include this when it is revised this year. \n\nIn September 2015, a BBC investigation revealed there were 5,500 sexual offences recorded in UK schools between 2011 and 2014.\n\nAmong these were nearly 4,000 alleged physical sexual assaults and more than 600 rapes, figures from Freedom of Information requests showed.\n\nAt least a fifth of offences were carried out by children on children, but details of the rest of the assaults are not known.\n\nSince last year's report, the Children and Social Work Act (2017) has made relationships education for all primary school children and relationships and sex education for all secondary school children compulsory.\n\nMs Miller called for more \"urgency\" from government to tackle the issue. Even when statutory guidance is issued to schools, it will still take a full academic year to come into force, she said. \n\n'Not sufficient'\n\nMinister for Women Anne Milton said she hoped new draft regulations and guidance on relationships and sex education would be published in 2018.\n\nHowever she said this alone was \"not sufficient\" and \"all schools have a legislative duty to safeguard and protect children\".\n\nShe added: \"In a serious situation - a number of serious and harrowing situations have been raised today - if parents or carers do not think that a child is safe, they should go to children's social care. \n\n\"Alternatively, if a parent or carer feels that a school is not fulfilling its duty because either it is not following its policies or it has inadequate policies, there is a whistleblowing line with Ofsted and the NSPCC.\"\n\n"

        ],
        "text":"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance Reporter\n\n1. Who is affected by the changes?\n\nThe big change affects 4.5 million people with Defined Contribution (DC) schemes. \n\nWith this type of scheme your monthly pension savings go into a big pot, which will eventually be used to buy an income for your retirement. You can now access that pot freely from the age of 55 (57 from 2028), taking out as much as you like, subject to tax. \n\nSome people with Defined Benefit (DB) pensions - which promise a particular annual income - will be able to swap them for DC schemes.\n\n2. How much tax will I have to pay?\n\nYou can take 25% of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. Or you can take out smaller amounts, of which the first 25% will be tax free on each occasion. \n\nBut you will have to pay income tax on the amount you withdraw over and above the 25% tax-free allowance.\n\nIf that amount, added to the rest of your income, exceeds \u00a342,386 (2015-16), for example, you will pay tax at 40% or more.\n\nIf the amount exceeds \u00a3100,000, you will begin to lose your personal allowance, resulting in an even higher tax charge.\n\n3. What tax will I have to pay if I buy a pension income?\n\nIf you buy an annuity (an income for life), or you take income drawdown (leaving your pension pot invested), you will only pay tax on the income. \n\nAnyone with total income below \u00a310,600 in 2015-16 will not pay anything.\n\n4. How easy is it to pass on a pension to my dependants?\n\nThe new rules make it easier. If you die before the age of 75, the pension pot can be passed on tax free. \n\nIf you die after 75, and your descendants want the whole pot as a lump sum, they will have to pay 45% tax, instead of 55% previously. \n\nHowever, the government is considering whether to reduce this to an individual's income tax rate - known as the marginal rate - from April 2016. \n\nThose who draw down income from an inherited pot will, in any case, pay tax at their marginal rate.\n\nPension Calculators\n\nState pension calculator DWP\n\nCombined state, workplace and DC calculator, from Standard Life\n\nShould I delay buying an annuity? Hargreaves Lansdown \n\nHow much can I earn from a DC pot? Money Advice Service\n\n5. Are annuities still a good idea?\n\nThe pension changes mean that many people who would have bought an annuity, will not now do so. \n\nIncome drawdown is a more flexible option for many. In fact it has not been compulsory to buy an annuity since April 2011. \n\nNevertheless, for many people, annuities will still be the best option - or a mixture of an annuity and drawdown.\n\n6. Can I sell an annuity if I have already bought one?\n\nIn the Budget of March 2015, the chancellor said he would make this possible, and the government will now carry out a consultation. This could allow you to swap your annuity for cash, from April 2016. \n\nHowever, no one knows how much demand there will be for second-hand annuities. Many suspect that those selling their annuities will find it hard to get a good price.  \n\n7. What if I am in a Defined Benefit (DB) scheme - can I move to a DC scheme?\n\nIn theory you can - if your employer allows it. Transferring to a DC scheme means you could get your money out more easily, and pass it on to descendants. But again, you may not get the best value. \n\nDB schemes usually offer inflation proofing, and the ability to pass some of the income on to a spouse.\n\nThey also have a particular advantage if you are getting close to the maximum amount you are allowed to have in a pension pot (see below).\n\n8. What are the new rules on how much you can save in a pension?\n\nFrom 6 April 2016, the maximum you can have in a pension pot will be \u00a31m, reduced from \u00a31.25m. This figure will rise with inflation from April 2018. The government says the change will only affect wealthy people.\n\nBut a 60 year-old spending all their \u00a31m pension pot on an inflation-linked annuity could - according to current annuity rates - expect a maximum annual income of around \u00a327,000. You can have a larger pension pot if you wish, but you will pay 55% tax on any withdrawals.\n\nHowever, anyone in a DB scheme will be treated more generously.\n\nSuch schemes have a notional capital value, calculated by multiplying the annual income by 20. So if the scheme pays an income of \u00a310,000 a year, the notional value of the pension pot is \u00a3200,000.\n\nGiven that the maximum pot will now be \u00a31m, members of DB schemes can therefore expect annual incomes of up to \u00a350,000.\n\nThe annual allowance for pensions savings remains at \u00a340,000.\n\n9. Is the state pension changing?\n\nYes. From 6 April 2016. The additional state pension and part of pension credit is being abolished, to be replaced with a single-tier state pension. The rate will rise from \u00a3113 a week to around \u00a3155, but the precise amount will be set towards the end of 2015. \n\nHowever, most people will not qualify for the full pension, as their schemes were contracted out of the second state pension, and they paid lower National Insurance (NI) contributions as a result. To qualify for the full pension, you will now need 35 years of NI contributions, instead of 30 previously.\n\n10. What advice is available?\n\nFree guidance - not advice - is available through the Pension Wise website. \n\nThose aged 55 or above can book a telephone interview with the Pensions Advisory Service, or a face-to-face interview with Citizens Advice. \n\nThe service will give general guidance, but cannot advise on specific pension policies or investments. \n\nThe number to book is 030 0330 1001. Otherwise advice can be had through private providers, which will usually be chargeable.\n\n"

        "text":"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter\n\nWhile female tech bosses like Marissa Mayer aren't quite as rare as hen's teeth, her appointment generated far more headlines than a man's would have.\n\nSo why when technology is becoming increasingly desirable, is there little desire to work in IT, especially for girls?\n\nIn the UK, 84% of IT professionals are men. \n\nMany companies want more women involved - in a survey conducted by IT recruitment company CW Jobs, 64% said more females in the workplace would be beneficial.\n\n\"There is this conception that IT is men with long hair sitting in air-tight rooms programming all day,\" said the company's website director Richard Nott.\n\nJava club\n\nThis image problem starts at school, according to one teacher.\n\n\"Girls don't see IT as creative. It is that image of the geek or nerd in a room typing lines of code,\" said Peter Mapstone, head of IT at King Edward VI school in Hampshire.\n\nGender differences become apparent during IT lessons, even though there is no difference in ability, according to Carol Dawkins, an IT teacher at Toynbee School in Chandlers Ford.\n\n\"Boys are more, 'Game on' - they don't mind if they make mistakes. They are more confident around the technology, whereas girls are a little bit shy, on the back foot before they start,\" she said.\n\nThe point is perfectly illustrated by Toynbee's after-school Java club - only boys have signed up.\n\n\"For the boys, hacking Linux is their comfort zone - whereas for girls, technology is all about email and Facebook,\" said Mrs Dawkins.\n\nWhen IBM's master inventor Mandy Chessell was at school, she said she had \"missed the memo which said that girls don't do maths and science\".\n\nBut she had a rude awakening when she joined her classmates in her first O-level lesson and realised she was the only girl.\n\nNow working at IBM's Hursley laboratory, Ms Chessell has long since got used to working in male-dominated environments.\n\nIt hasn't held her back - she is now one of IBM's few senior female engineers and recently won the Cisco Women In Technology award.\n\nAnd she is clear about the need for women at senior levels in technology firms.\n\n\"You can become a leader and you can lead in feminine ways,\" she said.\n\nFor her, this means a greater emphasis on collaboration.\n\n\"For junior technology roles, often the emphasis is on logical skills, which may put girls off, but most systems these days are put together as part of team effort,\" she said.\n\nIBM has a series of projects aimed at encouraging girls to take more science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects.\n\nThe BBC took part in its Think IT workshop in July, where 100 girls aged 12 and 13 came to IBM's lab to find out more about how a technology product comes to market.\n\nThe girls were divided into teams, each named after a famous female technologist or scientist, and asked to come up with a new piece of sport technology, from apps through to running shoes.\n\nIBM has reaped some rewards from the scheme - several girls that have been through the programme have gone on to become apprentices at the firm.\n\nIndeed the girls on the course seemed fired up by what they were doing, but none wanted to take it to exam level.\n\nInterestingly, few felt that ICT was a difficult subject, some actively enjoy it, but none of those the BBC spoke to wanted to pursue it as a career.\n\n\"I enjoy it, but I don't want to do it as a job,\" said Carys, aged 13.\n\nBut it isn't down to lack of confidence in the subject. \"We are better than the boys,\" said one girl bluntly.\n\nRuth Amos, now 23, won a young engineer of the year award when she was 16.\n\nFor her, it was a gradual realisation that engineering didn't have to be about dirty overalls.\n\n\"I realised that I could do it and wear a dress and nice shoes and still be me,\" she said.\n\nShe believes Stem subjects need a higher profile in the media.\n\n\"It really upsets me when I see girls watching shows like The Only Way is Essex and aspiring to be like that. Why not give that air time to inspiring them about Stem? Look at what The Apprentice and Dragon's Den have done for entrepreneurs.\" she said.\n\nRecently she has taken part in Soapbox Science, a project where women in technology, engineering and science literally take to soap boxes on London's south bank to evangelise their chosen careers.\n\nBut she thinks the discussion about why girls don't want to be geeks will continue for a while.\n\n\"We have been talking about it for ever and, while things are changing, it is very gradual,\" she said.\n\nYahoo's new boss Marissa Mayer has promised to address the issue of too few women in the tech industry, but she may face a tough job.\n\nLast month Microsoft had to apologise when a chunk of code emerged labelled \"big boobs\".\n\nThere is clearly some way to go.\n\n"

The firm says it was diligent in responding to complaints about pirated material.\n\nIn response, the hackers group Anonymous has targeted the FBI and US Department of Justice websites.\n\nThe news came a day after anti-piracy law protests, but investigators said they were ordered two weeks ago.\n\nThe US Justice Department said that Megaupload's two co-founders Kim Dotcom, formerly known as Kim Schmitz, and Mathias Ortmann were arrested in Auckland, New Zealand along with two other employees of the business at the request of US officials. It added that three other defendants were still at large.\n\n\"This action is among the largest criminal copyright cases ever brought by the United States and directly targets the misuse of a public content storage and distribution site to commit and facilitate intellectual property crime,\"said a statementposted on its website.\n\nThe FBI website was intermittently unavailable on Thursday evening due to what officials said was being \"treated as a malicious act\".\n\nThe hackers' group Anonymous said it was carrying out the attacks.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America's website also suffered disruption.\n\nThird-party sites\n\nThe charges included, conspiracies to commit racketeering, copyright infringement and money laundering.\n\nA federal court in Virginia ordered that 18 domain names associated with the Hong Kong-based firm be seized.\n\nThe Justice Department said that more than 20 search warrants had been executed in nine countries, and that approximately $50m (\u00a332m) in assets had been seized.\n\nIt claimed that the accused had pursued a business model designed to promote the uploading of copyrighted works.\n\n\"The conspirators allegedly paid users whom they specifically knew uploaded infringing content, and publicised their links to users throughout the world,\" a statement said.\n\n\"By actively supporting the use of third-party linking sites to publicise infringing content, the conspirators did not need to publicise such content on the Megaupload site.\n\n\"Instead, the indictment alleges that the conspirators manipulated the perception of content available on their servers by not providing a public search function on the Megaupload site and by not including popular infringing content on the publicly available lists of top content downloaded by its users.\"\n\nBefore it was shut down the site posted a statement saying the allegations against it were \"grotesquely overblown\".\n\n\"The fact is that the vast majority of Mega's internet traffic is legitimate, and we are here to stay,\" it added.\n\n\"If the content industry would like to take advantage of our popularity, we are happy to enter into a dialogue.

But it appears that officials are able to use existing tools to go after a business alleged to be inducing piracy,\" said Gartner's media distribution expert Mike McGuire.\n\n\"It begs the question that if you can find and arrest people who are suspected to be involved in piracy using existing laws, then why introduce further regulations which are US-only and potentially damaging?\"\n\n"

        "text":"By Katy WatsonBBC News, Tanc\u00edtaro, Michoac\u00e1n\n\nA mariachi band is playing as I arrive. The music is part of a funeral procession with Tanc\u00edtaro residents watching on.\n\nBut there is something that makes this quaint little town feel different. The pickup trucks ubiquitous in Mexico are shinier and newer here. \n\nTanc\u00edtaro is powered on avocados, its people are rich from Mexico's green gold. This town is known as Mexico's avocado capital. \n\nThe municipality of about 30,000 people produces enough avocados to satisfy the demand of all of California. \n\nMexico produces about 45% of the world's avocados and Michoac\u00e1n is Mexico's largest avocado-producing state. \n\nFrom here alone, nearly two billion avocados are shipped to the US every year. \n\nAnd because the industry is a lucrative one, it has been the target of organised crime.\n\nAs you enter Tanc\u00edtaro, there are a series of checkpoints. They are known as filtros, or filters, by people here. \n\nSome are more informal than others. One has a few sandbags and some elderly men sitting on a broken car seat outside a hut. \n\nWe pass another one with several pickup trucks standing outside. I notice a man with a rifle across his back. This is a well-armed town.\n\nMichoac\u00e1n is where the \"war on drugs\" started in 2006. \n\nThe strategy was launched by the then-president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, and its aim was to crack down on drug cartels by sending in troops. \n\nBut far from solving the problem of drug-related killings, it caused the cartels to fragment and violence increased further as rival factions fought each other for control of the drugs trade. \n\n\"From 2007, armed people started coming,\" says the mayor of Tanc\u00edtaro, Arturo Olivera Guti\u00e9rrez. \n\n\"They started to pressure local authorities, to take control of the local police and take over the population through fear. Many people disappeared, they started killing, intimidating, taking over land.\"\n\nIn the absence of an effective police force, communities armed themselves to ensure the security of their towns, leading to the emergence in 2013 of \"self-defence groups\" in Michoac\u00e1n.\n\nThe same happened in Tanc\u00edtaro, too. \n\nBut while in other parts of Michoac\u00e1n the self-defence groups were taken over by organised crime or dismantled by government forces, residents of Tanc\u00edtaro did something different. \n\nAvocado police\n\nOn one side of the town's main square is the headquarters of Tanc\u00edtaro's public security body (CUSEPT). \n\nThere are nine or 10 people standing outside wearing body armour and carrying guns. \n\n\"The self-defence groups freed the municipality from organised crime and then, in conjunction with the government, we worked with the avocado producers to recruit police,\" explains Jos\u00e9 Hugo S\u00e1nchez Mendoza, the head of CUSEPT.  \n\n\"The first prerequisite was that the force be made up of people from this municipality.\"   \n\nThe police force is part-funded by avocado producers, who pay a percentage of their earnings depending on how many hectares they own. \n\nThe municipal government also contributes to the force and its members get training from federal forces. \n\nEveryone in CUSEPT is connected to the avocado trade in some form, which Tanc\u00edtaro's mayor reckons is its recipe for success. \n\nPeople have a lot to lose and want to protect it, he explains.\n\nThey also have money. Their equipment is impressive. They all carry arms, wear body armour and have a bullet-proof pickup. \n\nOn one of their patrols, I sit next to Lorena Flores, who has her own farm. \n\nShe tells me she signed up because she was fed up with paying extortion to criminals. \n\nShe works with the force from Monday to Friday, eight to four. The time off is spent on her farm. She says that life here is much safer now. \n\nCommunity watchdogs\n\nAt one point we stop at a junction where there is a checkpoint, a two-storey house painted in camouflage colours. \n\nOpposite the checkpoint is a group of men, chatting by their cars. \n\nThey are one of 16 different community groups that work with police here, tipping them off about anything that is suspicious. \n\nThe men told me they had weapons but did not want to show me. \n\nThe police say the community groups do not carry guns openly but that they are there to help the police and inform them. \n\nIt is a bit of a grey area but one that seems to work for the town. \n\nBetter safe than sorry\n\nLater I meet Chema Flores, a wealthy farmer who has been in the avocado business since 1982.\n\nHe says he never imagined the demand for avocados would take off the way it has. \n\nIt has changed his life for good and bad. \n\nDown the side of the driver's seat I spot a huge gun. I ask him why he has it. \n\n\"At the moment, here it's safe, there's lots of security but in other areas it's ugly, I don't want to lie,\" he tells me. \n\n\"They kidnapped my son when he was 16. They asked for $1m [\u00a3760,000] but I only had $500,000 to give them. I was also kidnapped twice.\"\n\nHe tells me he has permission to carry a gun and employs four armed bodyguards to protect him and his son around the clock.\n\nThe need for such security feels extreme for a farmer but you can see how the alternative could be worse.\n\nEveryone in the town tells me that there are no kidnappings, no extortions now. \n\nProducers like Lorena and Chema can sleep sound at night. \n\nTanc\u00edtaro's heavily armed avocado police in its own way is a bright spot in a dark period for Mexico. \n\nThis year so far is the deadliest for the country in two decades.\n\n"

Now, what we think is not necessarily what we say!\"\n\nAlthough the characters will be subject to the same restrictions as the rest of the UK, the plot won't focus solely on coronavirus - with upcoming episodes featuring storylines about Tracy and Harrison competing to become captain of the village cricket team, and a minor emergency caused by a broken down forage harvester. \n\nLast week, the series' editor Jeremy Howe revealed how coronavirus had thrown the soap's plans into disarray.\n\n\"We binned 12 scripts and five weeks' worth of storylines that were about to be written,\" he told Radio Times. \n\n\"We then started inventing stories that were set in Ambridge, where the coronavirus had now arrived, that could be told in a way that both reflected the lockdown and could be recorded in the cast's homes. \n\n\"I told the team - keep it simple.\"\n\nFor the actors, the lockdown meant recording their monologues at home in hastily-constructed makeshift studios.\n\nAnnabelle Dowler, who plays Kirsty Miller, has been recording her scripts in her daughter's wardrobe, surrounded by duvets and and an old mattress to mask any external noises.  \n\nOn her Twitter account, she shared a photo of the notice she'd attached to the wardrobe door, warning her children to keep their distance.\n\n\"Stay away and be silent otherwise you will get into trouble with the BBC and we will have no iPlayer for the rest of the lockdown!\"\n\nHer co-star Charlotte Martin explained the challenges of recording in her bedroom. \n\n\"A studio is soundproof, whereas suddenly we were having to do it in our own homes,\" she said.\n\n\"I've got my two daughters home and making sure everything is quiet, that nobody is opening doors, that was tricky. I think my husband came up the stairs at one point and we had to redo that!\"\n\nShe added that, as the crew adapt to new ways of recording the 69-year-old drama, they might be able to start incorporating more voices.\n\n\"There may be ways that we can get actors talking to each other or create ways in which we can interact with more than one character at a time, but that will be in the future.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the lockdown has provided one character with a lucky escape.  \n\nBefore the lockdown, Kirsty was due to marry handyman Philip Moss, who listeners recently discovered was an illegal gangmaster - employing slave labour in his building firm.\n\nFor now, at least, those plans are on hold.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "text":"Parliament Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said a tweet by Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher was \"insulting\" to Russians and Americans.\n\nOn Monday she tweeted: \"Dear President Putin, Hitler and Stalin colluded to start WWII.\" \n\nPresident Vladimir Putin says Poland and its allies are distorting history.\n\nDuring a marathon news conference on 19 December, the Russian president said it was \"totally unacceptable and inaccurate\" to cast equal blame on Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin for the war's outbreak.\n\nMr Putin said he had requested Soviet archive documents in order to write an article on the subject - Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 - and, in his view, to set the record straight.\n\nHe argued that the Western powers and Poland had appeased Hitler's aggression by letting him grab Czechoslovakia in 1938.\n\nThe Nazi invasion of Poland came just a week after Hitler's Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had signed a non-aggression pact on 23 August 1939, which stunned the world.\n\nA secret clause in the pact carved up Eastern Europe into Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence, allowing the two dictators - one fascist, the other communist - to occupy and dismantle Poland. \n\nMs Mosbacher's tweet recalled that Poland was a victim of the two dictators. \n\nBut Mr Volodin, who is close to Mr Putin, said the US state department ought to make sure that an ambassador such as Ms Mosbacher had sufficient knowledge of a country's history before sending her to work there.\n\nMr Putin has revived wartime Soviet symbols, and portraits of Stalin are commonly displayed in Russia now.\n\nIn 2020, the 75th anniversary of the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany will be marked.\n\nMore than 20 million Soviet citizens died in what Russians call the \"Great Patriotic War\" after the Nazis invaded the USSR in 1941. Mr Putin's father served in Stalin's NKVD secret police and was severely wounded in the war in 1942.\n\nPresident Putin argued that Stalin had tried to forge an anti-Hitler alliance with Britain, France and Poland, but that the Munich Agreement in 1938 - dooming Czechoslovakia - had scuppered that plan. Stalin then had to reach a deal with Hitler, feeling betrayed by the West, he argued.\n\nHowever, Western historians point out that the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact meant Hitler did not have to fear a clash with the USSR if he invaded Poland, so giving him the assurance he needed.\n\nMoreover, Stalin then supplied the Nazi war machine with raw materials, which helped fuel - literally - Hitler's aggression against Western Europe.\n\nHow has this row escalated?\n\nMonday, 30 December: Besides the tweet by the US ambassador, Germany's ambassador to Poland - Rolf Nikel - also wades into the row, tweeting: \"The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact served to prepare the criminal invasion of Nazi Germany against Poland. The USSR together with Germany participated in this brutal division of Poland.\"\n\n29 December: Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki issues a statement accusing Mr Putin of using the World War Two issue as a means to cover up recent international setbacks for Russia, such as the sports sanctions imposed over Russian doping. Mr Morawiecki says \"President Putin has lied about Poland on numerous occasions\". \n\n27 December: Poland's foreign ministry summons the Russian ambassador to protest, recalling that the war began with the Nazi-Soviet pact, and that Poland lost about six million citizens in the war. Earlier, Mr Putin had scorned Poland and Western powers for appeasing Hitler and had labelled Poland's ambassador to Berlin in the 1930s an \"anti-Semitic swine\".\n\n19 September: A European Parliament resolution - politically significant, but not a law - urges EU states to \"make a clear and principled assessment of the crimes and acts of aggression perpetrated by the totalitarian communist regimes and the Nazi regime\". It describes the war as \"an immediate result\" of the infamous Nazi-Soviet deal in 1939.\n\n"

We believe it's time for a reboot.\"\n\nRecommendations include a call for a review of senior leadership capacity within both NWIS and the wider NHS digital team.\n\nGPs said the report had raised some \"alarming findings\" and data outages were becoming \"all too common\".\n\nDr Peter Saul, of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said: \"Today, IT systems are as critical to clinicians as stethoscopes and scanners. Data outages can be extraordinarily disruptive for practices and for patients. \n\n\"They affect appointments, prescriptions and the nuts and bolts of a functioning practice and can take hours to recover from.\" \n\nThe NWIS welcomed the report and said it had been \"pleased to share insight into the specification, planning, delivery and management of national digital health and care services for Wales\".\n\nThe Welsh Government said it would provide a considered response in due course.\n\n"

I had a plan B straight away, find somewhere safe to camp, put my tent up, keep warm, and that was it. \n\n\"The biggest problem I had was getting to Tynemouth from Keld, because I only had \u00a321.05 in my pocket.\"\n\nMr Harvey said he had \"three good nights wild camping\". \n\n\"The place where we got separated was absolutely desolate, there was no chance of putting a tent up that's for sure, so I had to find somewhere safe, which is what I did.\"\n\nMr Harvey said he was never worried as he had \"all the kit and all the training\", adding he would rather not have the attention which he said was \"not my scene at all\". \n\nThe experienced hiker, who was reported missing on Sunday afternoon, said he could see search teams but did not realise they were looking for him.\n\nHis family said the past three days had been \"torture\" and they could not put the worry they had into words. \n\n\"We know he is experienced, but not three nights, that's taking it a little bit to the extreme,\" they said.\n\nInsp Mark Gee, from North Yorkshire Police, said: \"This is fantastic news.

Have you been missing for three days?' And he said yes. And I started crying.\"\n\nMs Pyrah said he had a nasty bump on the head where he had fallen into a stream, but apart from that he was fit and well. \n\n\"I got him some help for his head and he rang his wife, which was the main thing,\" she said.\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

It made the government look stupid at best and institutionally corrupt at worst - many people doubted El Chapo's escape could have happened without inside help. \n\nIt was made worse too by the fact that the president had previously said that if he escaped again it would be unforgivable.\n\nMr Pena Nieto has called the arrest \"mission accomplished\" - hopefully it is third-time lucky for the government with El Chapo remaining behind bars and the president's legacy not being that of allowing a violent criminal to escape.\n\nWho is 'El Chapo' Guzman?\n\nThe US congratulated the Mexican government but did not indicate whether prosecutors would seek Guzman's extradition.\n\nIn a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Guzman had caused \"significant violence, suffering and corruption on multiple continents\".\n\nGuzman's July escape was his second - he was first arrested in Guatemala in 1993 and escaped from Puente Grande jail in 2001, reportedly in a laundry basket after bribing officials.\n\nHe was on the run for 13 years before being held again in 2014. \n\nCCTV footage of his 11 July escape showed Guzman pacing his cell several times before heading into the shower area and disappearing at the maximum-security Altiplano jail.\n\nA huge manhunt followed, with flights suspended at the nearby airports. The US government had offered a $5m (\u00a33.2m) reward for information leading to his capture. \n\nAuthorities located him several days ago based on reports that he was in the Los Mochis area.\n\nIn October, Mexican officials said they had \"broken up\" and arrested the group responsible for helping him escape.\n\nGuzman's wealth is estimated at $1bn.\n\nDespite being the leader of one of the world's most powerful and violent drug cartels, Guzman was seen by some in Sinaloa - where there are few job opportunities - as a modern-day Robin Hood figure who could offer more security to people than the government.\n\nFollowing his escape, shopkeepers began selling souvenirs such as baseball caps branded with \"El Chapo\" (Guzman's nickname, meaning \"Shorty\"). \n\n"

        "text":"In a speech to party members, Rishi Sunak said the Conservatives had a \"sacred duty\" to \"leave the public finances strong\".\n\nHe vowed the use the \"overwhelming might of the British state\" to help people find new work.\n\nBut he said debt and spending needed controlling \"over the medium term\". \n\nIn an online speech during the Conservatives' annual party conference, he said: \"I won't stop trying to find ways to support people and businesses.\"\n\nHowever, he added the party could not argue there was \"no limit on what we can spend\", nor that \"we can simply borrow our way out of any hole\". \n\nMr Sunak cited the furlough scheme and its successor, the jobs support scheme, as examples of government action to support employment during the crisis. \n\nHe said though that, although the government would \"keep striving to be creative\" on employment support, he would also have to be \"pragmatic\". \n\nHe told members that \"no chancellor\" would be able to save every job or business, adding changes to the economy due to Covid-19 \"can't be ignored\".\n\nOfficial figures published in September show government borrowed \u00a335.9bn in the previous month, its highest amount for August since records began in 1993.\n\nBorrowing between April and August totalled \u00a3173.7bn, as ministers spent billions on coronavirus-related schemes to support the economy. \n\nSunak keen to shrug off big-spending reputation \n\nGovernment borrowing is at stratospheric levels because of the pandemic. \n\nIt is not clear precisely what the chancellor means, promising to get it under control in the \"medium term\".\n\nNor was there even a whisper of how that could be done.\n\nTreasury sources suggested it's unlikely to happen by the time of the next election, likely to be in 2024.\n\nBut while the chancellor's first few months in the job have been characterised by enormous crisis-level spending, that is a characteristic that he is keen to shrug off.\n\nRead more from Laura \n\nIn an interview after his speech, the chancellor said government debt - which passed \u00a32 trillion for the first time in history in August - was vulnerable to increases in borrowing costs. \n\n\"Now that we have so much debt, it doesn't take a lot for suddenly 'yikes' - we have to come up with X billion pounds a year to pay for higher interest,\" he said. \n\nMr Sunak - who has been touted as a potential future Tory leader - also said he did not want to become PM, and described his \"close personal friendship\" with Boris Johnson.\n\nAsked if he eventually wants to replace Mr Johnson, he replied: \"No. Definitely not seeing what the prime minister has to deal with, this is a job hard enough for me to do.\"\n\nBBC economics editor Faisal Islam said: \"The chancellor knows that just days after his Winter Economic Plan, with unemployment set to go above 5%, and social restrictions intensifying, not loosening, there is now further backroom pressure to increase the generosity of his worker subsidy schemes. \n\n\"This is a continuation of the pattern we have seen in the past few weeks since the cancellation of the Budget. There'll be more support for the economy, but with the really tough decisions - for example, on tax, - put off.\n\nIn response to his speech, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak had \"nothing to say\" to millions of people whose jobs were at risk. \n\nShe told reporters more \"targeted support\" was required for sectors of the economy that have been hardest hit by restrictions during the pandemic. \n\n\"Sadly there was nothing from the chancellor today to suggest that he grasped the magnitude of the jobs crisis we're facing,\" she added. \n\nDame Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, said the best way to balance the books was by \"protecting our economy's ability to recover\".\n\nAdding that the costs of the pandemic had fallen \"deeply and unevenly,\" she said it was vital to protect at-risk sectors such as aviation, manufacturing, and hospitality.\n\nDo Conservative governments balance the books?\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak told the virtual Conservative Party conference: \"This Conservative government will always balance the books.\"\n\nIf it does, that would be an unusual achievement.\n\nBalancing the books usually means that a government has repaid more than it has borrowed in a year - ie it's in surplus. \n\nThe government can still have debt overall, but the debt hasn't risen during the year. \n\nThe last time that a government balanced the books was under the Labour government in 2000-01, and for the two years before that.\n\nThe most recent Conservative government to achieve that was under Margaret Thatcher in 1988-89 and 1989-90.\n\nAnother measure that recent governments have liked to talk about is whether the economy is growing faster than the debt. If it is, the government can say that debt is falling as a proportion of GDP (which is the value of everything produced by the economy in a year).\n\nThat happened in both 2017-18 and 2018-19. \n\n"

Membership talks were launched in 2005, but have stalled over serious misgivings about Turkey's human rights record. \n\nKurds make up about a fifth of the population.

Long decline begins.\n\n1908 - Young Turk Revolution establishes constitutional rule, but degenerates into military dictatorship during First World War, where Ottoman Empire fights in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary.\n\n1918-22 - Partition of defeated Ottoman Empire leads to eventual triumph of Turkish National Movement in war of independence against foreign occupation and rule of Sultan.\n\n1923 - Turkey declared a republic with Kemal Ataturk as president. Soon afterwards it becomes secular.\n\n1952 - Turkey abandons Ataturk's neutralist policy and joins Nato.\n\n1960 - Army coup against ruling Democratic Party.\n\n1974 - Turkish troops occupy northern Cyprus, partitioning the island.\n\n1984 - Kurdish PKK group launches separatists guerrilla campaign which develops into a major civil war that simmers on for decades. \n\n2011 - Syrian civil war breaks out, resulting in tension along the countries' border and a huge influx of refugees into Turkey.\n\n2016 - Attempted coup fails. \n\n2017 - Referendum approves switch to presidential system.\n\n"

        "text":"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter\n\nA wisecracking way of trying to cover the question about how she and Donald Trump can work together - the reality TV star billionaire and the self-described hard working vicar's daughter. \n\nVoters will decide for themselves how funny they find it. \n\nBut Number 10 has already invested a lot in the early days of this relationship. \n\nPerhaps, that is in part due to the early embarrassment of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's adventures in Manhattan. However, it is also certainly due to her conviction that whoever the US president is, a British leader needs to, and should, cultivate their friendship. \n\nDowning Street sources say they have had more contact with the Trump team since its victory than any other country has - and the conversations between the two leaders have focused on how to develop their personal relationship and the bond between the two countries. \n\nBut even before the two politicians meet tomorrow in the Oval Office, Mrs May is trying to put forward serious arguments about Britain and America's relationship as the world changes at warp speed around the two countries - making a major foreign policy speech at a gathering of the Republican Party in Philadelphia just hours after she touches down. \n\nNo change on torture\n\nIt is plain to see that while she is deadly serious about creating an extremely close relationship with the new president, she will continue to disagree with him on some issues.  \n\nWhen repeatedly questioned about his view that torture works, the prime minister told us: \"We condemn torture, I have been very clear, I'm not going to change my position whether I'm talking to you or talking to the president.\"  \n\nAnd crucially, she said guidance stating that UK security services cannot share intelligence if it is obtained through torture will not change, telling me: \"Our guidance is very clear about the position that the UK takes, and our position has not changed.\"\n\nDespite President Trump's very public doubts about Nato, she says he has already assured her on the phone that he is committed to the alliance.  \n\nA public restatement of that in the next 24 hours would no doubt be a political boon for her. \n\nWhile the prime minister is plainly uncomfortable with some of Mr Trump's positions, she also wants to emphasise some of the areas where they do agree - the \"shared values\" of looking out for \"ordinary working class families\".  \n\nIn her speech to senators and congressmen tonight she will also emphasise how, in her view, Conservative values are Republican values.\n\nThe Republicans - the Tories' sister political party - are now in charge at all levels on Capitol Hill, as well as inside the White House. For the GOP and Mrs May's Conservative Party, patriotism, flag and family are not values to shy away from. \n\nAnd despite the squeamishness, even in Tory ranks, about her eagerness to be seen alongside the president, the prime minister is unapologetic about her friendly stance. \n\nWhen asked about appearing to be too close to the controversial new president, she said: \"Donald Trump was elected president of the United States of America. \n\n\"The UK and the US have shared challenges, shared interests, that we can work together to deal with. We have a special relationship, it's long standing, it's existed through many different prime ministers and presidents.\" \n\nA more different prime minister and president are hard to conceive. What they make of each other, and the relationship between our two countries, will affect us all. \n\n"

If you knew everything about the DNA of a child and their grandparents, you could figure out a lot about about the DNA of the parents too.\n\nThe deCODE genetics team has taken the whole genome sequence of 10,000 people and combined it with nation-wide family trees.\n\n\"By using these tricks we can predict, with substantial accuracy, the genome of the entire nation,\" the chief executive of deCODE, Dr Kari Stefansson told the BBC News website.\n\nMedicine\n\nMutations in the BRCA genes lead to a much higher lifetime risk of cancer and led the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie to have her breasts and ovaries removed.\n\nDr Stefansson argued: \"We could, in Iceland, at the push of a button find all women who carry mutations in the BRCA2 gene.\n\n\"This risk could basically be nullified by preventative mastectomies and ovariectomies. It would be criminal not to take advantage of it and I am convinced that my fellow countrymen will begin to use it pretty soon.\"\n\nThe data is all anonymous at the moment. Using such data in medicine would raise ethical issues, including identifying deadly disease genes in people who never volunteered their own DNA for study.\n\nDr Stefansson says there is a lot of debate still to come \"but I'm just an old-fashioned physician, my gut instinct is simply to go to these people and warn them\".\n\nHe is already in discussions with the Icelandic healthcare system.\n\nElegant\n\nThe 100,000 genomes project in England and President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative both aim to use such genetic information to revolutionise medicine.  \n\nProfessor Mark Caulfield, the chief scientist at Genomics England, said the studies were \"very interesting\" and \"very elegant\".\n\nHe told the BBC: \"The team in Iceland is to be congratulated as it has continued, over many years, to contribute to an understanding of the genetic information of disease by looking at the level of the population.\"\n\nHe said the progress being made around the world showed: \"We are on the cusp on the application of transformative genomic medicine at scale\"\n\nHowever, he cautioned that there were many types of BRCA2 mutation and it was important to be certain they were relevant before informing women. \n\nCommon dad\n\nThe project made a series of other discoveries including a new gene linked to Alzheimer's disease. \n\nThe team has calculated a new estimate for the last common ancestor of all men by looking at the rate of mutation in the male Y-chromosome.\n\nThey believe the last common ancestor was 239,000 years ago - down from a previous estimate of 308,000 years ago.\n\nThey discovered that in Iceland that 8% of the population is missing all copies of a gene. \n\nThis could be harmful, beneficial or have no impact at all. The Icelandic group is starting a study to assess the health of these people. \n\nDr Susan Wallace, who worked with the Nuffield Council of Bioethics on a report on the use of biomedical data, said: \"It sounds like a very exciting study and could bring health benefits to people. \n\n\"The concerns are that the data is going to be made public, anonymity technically promises protection, but you can be re-identified in datasets.\n\n\"There are also concerns of commercial interests in the use of these databases, so there are a lot of concerns that need to be addressed.\n\n\"There needs to be more engagement I think.\"\n\n"

The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, says it doesn't hold data on the number of drinking fountains. \n\nWater UK, which will run the free water refill scheme, also could not provide figures.\n\nThe Drinking Fountain Association, founded as the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in 1959, owns 2,406 fountains in England, but the vast majority of these aren't working fountains - they are historic monuments.  \n\nHundreds of drinking fountains were installed in the Victorian times to promote public health - and as part of the temperance movement, with many being stationed outside pubs.\n\nThe advent of bottled water in the 1980s among other things pushed the need for drinking fountains down council priority lists. \n\n"

Now it is forecasting a net deficit of \u00a32.3bn by the end of March.\n\nThe findings suggest two-thirds of trusts expect to overspend by the end of the year, including 89% of acute hospital trusts. \n\nSceptical about savings\n\nA clear majority of finance directors from trusts and local commissioning groups were sceptical that the health service in England could meet annual efficiency savings of 2-3% up to 2020-21, as required by the NHS masterplan known as the Five Year Forward View.\n\nOne area that has been identified for savings is spending on agency staff. \n\nLast year, the Department of Health imposed a cap, but more than half of finance directors (53%) were concerned they would not be able to meet these limits. \n\nMore than 20% thought the cap would affect their ability to recruit in order to provide safe care.\n\nThe report highlights increasing concerns about the quality of services. A majority of the trust finance directors who responded - 53% - thought things had got worse in the last year. \n\nThey were particularly worried about delays in A&E. \n\nMany also expressed concern about delayed transfers of care and staff morale.\n\n'Increasing concerns'\n\nCommenting on the findings, the King's Fund's chief economist, Prof John Appleby, said they showed the NHS faced a huge financial challenge.\n\n\"Even with the additional funding recently provided by the Treasury and a big switch from capital to revenue spending, it is touch and go whether the Department of Health will be able to balance its budget at the end of the year. \n\n\"At the same time, performance is deteriorating with key targets being missed with increasing regularity and increasing concerns being raised about the quality of patient care. This is shaping up to be a make-or-break year for the NHS.\"\n\nHealth Minister Alistair Burt said: \"There should never be a choice between providing safe care - our top priority - and balancing the books, which is why we're investing \u00a310bn to fund the NHS's own plan for the future, including nearly \u00a34bn next year. \n\n\"Despite being busy, the NHS continues to perform well - last year the service performed 1.6 million more operations and treated 2,100 more people every day within the four-hour A&E target compared to 2010.\"\n\n"

The BBC takes a look around the world.\n\nChina\n\nWhen Mr Trump first announced a trade deal with China, he hailed it as \"very large and comprehensive\". \n\nIt was, he tweeted, \"by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country\".\n\nThis week,  the two sides finally got around to a signing a deal but some were far from convinced that the substance merited Mr Trump's descriptions. \n\nMost of the tariffs remain in place. The US will maintain levies of up to 25% on an estimated $360bn worth of Chinese goods while China is expected to keep tariffs on more than $100bn of US imports. \n\nEven the Trump administration conceded it fell short of original goals, describing it as a \"phase one\" agreement. \n\nNorth America\n\nIn 2018, the US, Canada and Mexico agreed to a deal that will govern the more than $1.1 trillion in trade between the three countries. \n\nThe pact, which has been slowly making its way through the legislatures of the three countries, will replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which Mr Trump has described as the \"worst\". \n\nHowever, despite a name change, a lot of the terms remain the same.\n\nThere are some differences, including stronger labour provisions and tougher rules on the sourcing of auto parts.\n\nBut analysts say their significance remains to be seen. Many of the other updates were worked out in negotiations that pre-dated Mr Trump.\n\nJapan and South Korea\n\nOne of Mr Trump's first moves as president was to withdraw the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership - a proposed 12-country deal that eventually went ahead without America, putting its exports at a disadvantage.\n\nMr Trump has since claimed two bilateral agreements in Asia, with Japan and South Korea, but the changes were so limited that Congressional researchers said they barely qualified as trade deals.\n\nIn the case of South Korea, the most notable provision actually preserved US tariffs on light duty trucks.\n\nWith Japan, the US won either levy cuts or complete elimination on $7bn worth of agricultural goods. But this was the same access America would have received under the Trans Pacific Partnership.\n\nEurope\n\nIn the case of Europe, there is no trade deal in sight.\n\nThe two sides went through a round of tit-for-tat tariffs after the US announced the steel and aluminium tariffs - measures that affect more than $10bn worth of two-way trade. \n\nThen, in October, the US imposed 25% tariffs on $7.5bn worth of European goods, including Scotch whisky, French wine and Italian cheese.\n\nIn that instance, Mr Trump's decision had the approval of the World Trade Organization, which had found that the European Union provided illegal subsidies to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. \n\nThe US president had made repeated threats to impose tariffs on European cars but that has never materialised.\n\nHowever, the White House continues to dangle the prospect of steep levies on other EU goods such as French produce in retaliation for France's new digital services tax..\n\nBrazil and Argentina\n\nHeads spun last month when Mr Trump announced on Twitter he wanted tariffs on steel and aluminium from Brazil and Argentina.\n\nThose countries had been exempted from higher duty on both metals but Mr Trump claimed the two nations had been devaluing their currencies \"which is not good for our farmers\".\n\nSo far, there has been no follow-up announcement from his administration and the threats have not materialised. \n\nFollowing a phone call with Mr Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he had been assured they would not happen.\n\n"

        "text":"By Steven RosenbergBBC News\n\nOn Russia's Black Sea coast I meet Vladimir Uglev, a scientist who helped develop nerve agents for the Soviet Union. \n\n\"The aim of the programme was to produce a substance far more powerful than the nerve agent VX - 10 times more powerful,\" he tells me. \"And that's what we got.\"\n\nMr Uglev, 71, claims he created the poison that was used in the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury on 4 March. It has been identified in Russia by the code A-234.  \n\n\"I can tell by the mass spectrometry readings, the presence of fluorine, by its molecular weight, and from all the spectrum data I was sent recently.\" \n\nBut if the nerve agent was so powerful, how did the Skripals survive? Vladimir believes they received a \"small dose\u2026 close to the threshold level.\" \n\nEarlier this week the UK revealed the poison was delivered \"in liquid form\".\n\nI ask Vladimir: if the nerve agent used in Salisbury was the one he synthesised, does the poisoning prey on his conscience? \n\n\"These are not the first victims on my conscience,\" he tells me. \"If I thought about it, I could probably count a dozen people who've been poisoned by our substances, in different circumstances, for example, at the military training ground. Then there was the case of scientist Andrei Zheleznyakov who got infected in the laboratory.\" \n\nVladimir Uglev worked at a state laboratory in Shikhany, in Russia's Saratov region. One day he himself was involved in an accident with a novichok. \n\n\"It was with 'novichok' A-240. The solvent boiled over and splashed on to my right hand. I put my hand into hydrochloric acid, then washed it with an alkaline peroxide solution and put it under the tap.\"\n\n\"You could say the Skripals and I are baptised by the same novichok, except that in my case it was A-240, not A-234. But it was my substance. And judging by how pure their test sample proved to be, this may well have been from a batch made by my own hands. It has a long shelf life, and virtually no expiry date.\"\n\nThe Russian state continues to insist it is innocent; that accusations against it over the Salisbury poisoning are part of a \"Russophobic\" plot and a \"provocation\" by Britain and America.  \n\nYulia Skripal, 33, was discharged from hospital in Salisbury earlier this month and her 66-year-old father is no longer in a critical condition. Officials say the highest concentration of the Novichok agent was found at their house.\n\nMoscow maintains there is no evidence that it targeted the Skripals.\n\n\"It's absolutely right,\" Vladimir Uglev tells me. \"You will never prove Russia's guilt. Unless you can find the actual test tube that contained the actual poison.\"\n\n\"But the logic of events suggests it was Russia, as does the way our leaders reacted. They were so quick to say 'It wasn't us!' It's like when a thief steals something at the market: he's the first to shout 'The thief's not here, he's over there! Catch him!'\"\n\nIs Vladimir Uglev surprised that his country stands accused of carrying out a chemical attack in the UK?  \n\n\"Not really,\" he tells me. \"And it's not Putin who is to blame. All of us in Russia are at fault. If this is what our country is like, what has Putin got to do with it? Replace Putin with Margaret Thatcher, and do you think anything would change? It wouldn't. The problem is that our society doesn't want to change.\"\n\n"

I thought there may be a simple technological solution and it has proved to be more difficult than that, but leads have emerged.\n\n\"They are no longer just sifting the haystack, there is now more focus to the investigation and it has narrowed.\"\n\nKevin Robinson, one of the founders of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said: \"It is deplorable, whoever was responsible for the comments.\n\n\"But to think it could have been somebody from Merseyside, who must know what the feelings are of people and the community as a whole, is outrageous to contemplate.\"\n\nA Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"Once we have the facts, the Minister for the Cabinet Office will update Parliament with the findings and consider further appropriate action.\n\n\"It would not be appropriate to comment further whilst this investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n"
